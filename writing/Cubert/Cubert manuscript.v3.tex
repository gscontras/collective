	What role does context have in the disambiguation between distributive and collective interpretations of plural predications? We focus on the phenomenon of ``stubborn distributivity,'' whereby certain predicates (e.g., \emph{big}, \emph{tall}) are claimed to lack collective interpretations altogether. First, we establish a method for studying plural predication experimentally, and demonstrate that interpretation choice is mediated by three factors: the immediate linguistic context, the local discourse context, and the broader world context. 
	Then, we formalize the contributions of context within the Bayesian Rational Speech-Acts framework, showing that stubborn distributivity emerges from the reasoning processes of speakers and listeners. 	
	%, using unambiguous paraphrases to isolate interpretations. Then, we apply our paraphrase endorsement method to naturally-occurring examples from corpora, finding that both the narrow linguistic context and the broader discourse context mediate interpretation choices. Next, we employ the paraphrase endorsement method while manipulating properties of the context directly, and find that the probability of an interpretation depends crucially on potential variability in the property being communicated; the more variable a collective property, the less likely a collective interpretation. Stubbornly distributive predicates name collective properties that are relatively unpredictable in and across contexts (e.g., collective size will depend crucially on the way a set of objects is arranged), which leads to more variable interpretations. A more variable interpretation is potentially less informative because it requires more coordination between speakers and listeners. The interpretation is therefore less useful to speakers for communicating about the state of the world, which makes it less likely. These facts support a general model of rational communication under which the resolution of ambiguities is sensitive to the amount of variability in possible interpretations.  We formalize this pragmatic calculus using a Bayesian Rational Speech-Act model of communication.

\section{Introduction}

The semantics and pragmatics of predicating properties to singular individuals is already a complicated endeavor. What does it mean for a box to be big, or tall, or heavy? How do we represent its size or height or weight? Recent answers to these sorts of questions highlight the central role of context in the calculus of meaning: what properties get ascribed depend crucially on the context of predication \citep[cf.~tall for a boy vs.~tall for a basketball player;  e.g.,][]{kennedy1999,lassitergoodman2013}. The complexity associated with answering these questions increases once we introduce pluralities into the mix. 
%: however difficult the singular case, the plural case is at least $n$ times as complicated, for the $n$ many individuals under consideration. 
Particularly puzzling is the distributive vs.~collective ambiguity of plural predcation \citep[e.g.,][]{link1983,link1987,link1998,scha1984,landman1989,landman1989b,landman1996,lasersohn1988,lasersohn1990,lasersohn1995,lasersohn1998,schwarzschild1994,schwarzschild1996}:

\ex. \label{boxes} The boxes are heavy.
\a. \label{boxeseach} The boxes each are heavy. \hfill \textsc{distributive}
\b. \label{boxestogether}The boxes together are heavy. \hfill \textsc{collective}

When hearing \Last we may infer that each box on its own counts as heavy, as in \Last[a], or only that their total weight is heavy, as in \Last[b].
%if we hear that \emph{the boxes are heavy}, do we infer that each box is, or only that their total weight warrants comment? 
What factors go into this determination of meaning?

Consider the well-documented yet poorly understood phenomenon of ``stubborn distributivity'' \citep{quine1960,schwarzschild2011,vazquezrojas2012,zhang2013,syrett2015}, whereby some predicates (e.g., \emph{heavy}) readily admit collective construals, whiles others (e.g., \emph{big}) do not. Current descriptions of the phenomenon treat it as a simple lexical distinction, an accident of semantics. 
\ndg{here briefly note the observation that happily collective properties tend to have stable collective measures...}
We will see, however, that the role of context in plural predication provides a ready explanation of stubborn distributivity in terms of the predictability, or subjectivity, of the collective reading. 
More generally, we take as our motivation the idea that context plays \emph{the} key role in disambiguation for distributive vs.~collective interpretations. We consider context at three levels: 1) the immediate linguistic context (e.g., the predicate and its plural subject), 2) the specific discourse context (e.g., the epistemic states of speakers and listeners), and 3) the broader world context (e.g., information about the properties under discussion and the objects said to hold them). \ndg{smooth out this paragraph some more..}

To address the issue of how (and how much) plural predication depends on context, we establish a way of studying plural predication experimentally. In Expt.~1, we introduce and validate a new methodology, which probes possible interpretations with unambiguous paraphrases. The results of Expt.~1 demonstrate a difference between \emph{big} and \emph{heavy}, as expected, but unexpectedly the stubbornly distributive predicate \emph{tall} patterns with \emph{heavy} in its ability to yield collective interpretations. We take these findings as evidence that stubborn distributivity might not be so stubborn after all, and that simple lexical distinction fails to do justice to the facts. %If it could, we should find \emph{tall} patterning with \emph{big}.

We extend our paraphrase methodology in Expt.~2 to naturally-occurring examples of plural predication from the British National Corpus and the Google Books Corpus. As in Expt.~1, we continue to observe the complaisant collectivity of \emph{heavy}. However, the role of context comes more sharply into focus: with subject nouns naming objects that suggest a contextually stable collective property (i.e., a predictable collective size or shape), stubbornly distributive \emph{small} and \emph{big} yield greater rates of collective interpretations. 

Following up on our corpus findings, we then explore the idea that contextual predictability of the relevant collective property is a critical factor in determining which reading is intended. Expt.~3 uses the paraphrase endorsement methodology to show that less variable contexts increase the predictability of potentially noisy collective interpretations%(e.g., always stacking objects on top of each other, regularizing the collective height of sets)
, and, as a result, make collective interpretations more probable. To understand why and how context  influences the interpretation of plural predication, we formalize its contribution under a pragmatic account of ambiguity resolution in plural predication, using a variant of the Rational Speech-Acts model \citep[e.g.,][]{frankgoodman2012,lassitergoodman2013}. The model explains the patterns of our data well, supporting the underlying hypotheses; hypotheses to which we turn next.



%Still, we do our best. What follows is a brief summary of some of the progress made in understanding the semantics and pragmatics of plurality, specifically as it relates to ambiguity and the semantics of gradability. As we shall see, 

\section{The puzzle: Stubborn distributivity}

%Some predicates are inherently distributive; these are singular-seeking predicates like \emph{die} or \emph{see} or \emph{have blue eyes}; also, \emph{man}. These predicates entail a distributive reading whenever they are used: the sentence \emph{Mary and Sue saw the giraffe} entails that each of Mary and Sue saw the giraffe; \emph{John and Bill are men} entails that each of John and Bill is a man.
%Formally, inherently distributive predicates apply only to singular individuals, and refuse pluralities from their basic denotations \citep{link1983}.
%
%But not all predicates need be distributive. To illustrate this fact, \cite{link1983} reproduces the following exchange between the German newspaper \emph{Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung} (FAZ) and the editor of \emph{Der Speigel}, Rudolf Augstein (RA): 
%
%\ex. FAZ: ``Which property do you appreciate most with your friends?''\\
%RA: ``That they are few.''
%
%Being few is not a property any one of RA's friends holds. In fact, it makes no sense to say of an individual that he or she is few. Rather, the friends {collectively} hold this property. \citeauthor{link1983} models this fact by assuming that the predicate \emph{be few} contains in its basic denotation \emph{only} pluralities of individuals.  According to the liturgy, distributive, singular-seeking predicates and collective, plurality-seeking predicates self-sort on conceptual grounds: being a man is a property that necessarily applies to singular individuals, while being few or gathering together are properties that cannot apply to singular individuals. 
%
%Some predicates are truly ambiguous, neither inherently distributive nor inherently collective. In uttering \emph{built a raft}, we are not \emph{a priori} committed to a specific interpretation: \Next could mean either distributive \Next[a] or collective \Next[b]. Without overt linguistic or contextual cues, the meaning of the bare predicate in is underdetermined.
%
%\ex. Bill and Charlie built a raft.
%\a. Bill and Charlie each built a raft. \hfill \textsc{distributive}
%\b. Bill and Charlie together built a raft. \hfill \textsc{collective}
%
%To better understand the factors that go into the disambiguation of mixed predicates like \emph{build a raft}, we consider in detail a specific class of predicates with more concrete, (relatively) objective evaluation strategies: gradable adjectives like \emph{heavy} or \emph{big}.%\footnote{This is not to say that we know nothing about collective action statements. For example, Margaret Gilbert's Plural Subject Theory makes great gains on this ground in the domain of social philosophy \citep[for a recent overview, see][]{gilbert2013}.} 
%The measurement inherent to the semantics of these predicates delivers scalar interpretations that are amenable to quantitative study. By examining intuitions about the use of these predicates, together with the predication context that delivers them, we stand to better understand the mechanism of plural predication: when collective interpretations are appropriate, what they communicate, and what mediates the choice between distributive and collective interpretations in the first place.
%
%\subsection{Stubborn distributivity}

When complaisantly collective gradable predicates like \emph{heavy} (also \emph{expensive}, \emph{voluminous}) are used in plural predications the meaning is ambigious. Under a distributive reading, \ref{boxeseach}, the relevant property gets ascribed to each member of the plural subject. Under a collective reading, \ref{boxestogether}, we ascribe the property to the subject as a whole---in the case of \ref{boxes} commenting on the total weight of the boxes; many light boxes may together count as heavy \citep{scha1984}.

%\ex. The boxes are heavy.
%\a. The boxes each are heavy. \hfill \textsc{distributive}
%\b. The boxes together are heavy. \hfill \textsc{collective}

%In this latter case, where we collectively ascribe a gradable property directly to a plurality, the resulting interpretation involves sum-based aggregation strategies: if a set of boxes together holds the property of being heavy, it follows that their total weight counts as heavy \citep{scha1984}.\footnote{For now we set aside the possibility of mean-based aggregation strategies, demonstrated for plural comparisons of size by \cite{scontrasetal2012}. Given the effect of contextual predictability on sum-based aggregation strategies that we herewith elucidate, the previously demonstrated mean-based strategies likely result from an experimental context that suggested collective interpretations for \emph{bigger} and a recognition on the part of participants that average size was sufficiently predictable in that context. \ndg{perhaps move this to discussion and discuss more transparently?}} The reading becomes more transparent when we add a collective particle like \emph{together}, as in \Last[b]. Crucially, a collective reading can be true when the distributive reading is false: many light boxes may together count as heavy. These two diverging interpretations suggest a semantics for the gradable predicate \emph{heavy} under which it applies both to singular objects and pluralities in its basic denotation; it is a mixed predicate (cf.~the example \emph{build a raft} from \citealp{link1983}). 

The collective interpretation available to \emph{heavy} proves elusive for most other gradable predicates. A speaker is hard-pressed to use the sentence in \Next to say of the boxes that their total size is large.

\ex. The boxes are big.
\a. The boxes each are big. \hfill \textsc{distributive}
%\z. \emph{but not}
\b. The boxes together are big. \hfill \ding{55}\textsc{collective}

Size and shape adjectives (e.g., \emph{tall}, \emph{long}, \emph{round}) resist collective interpretations. \cite{schwarzschild2011} terms them ``stubbornly distributive,'' signaling the lack of collective interpretations. \citet{zhang2013} labels this class of predicates ``delimitable,'' highlighting their usage to describe physical extents. Supporting the robustness of this phenomenon, \cite{syrett2015} finds evidence of stubborn distributivity in children as young as 3 years of age.

%In his discussion of the contrast, \citet{quine1960} describes stubbornly distributive predicates like \emph{big} in \Last as ``not cumulative,'' drawing a parallel with the nominal domain: just as a count noun like \emph{boxes} insistently ``divides its reference'' among individual boxes (in contrast to mass nouns like \emph{water} which are aggressively cumulative, referring to maximal salient quantities of water), so too do stubbornly distributive predicates divide their predication to individuals. \citeauthor{quine1960}'s characterization of the phenomenon prefigures the formal semantics that follows him. 

Collective predication arises when a property is ascribed directly to a plurality, rather than distributed among its members \citep{link1983}. Semanticists hold that stubbornly distributive predicates behave as such because they cannot contain pluralities in their basic denotations \citep{schwarzschild2011,vazquezrojas2012,zhang2013}.\footnote{In his characterization of stubborn distributivity, Schwarzschild first assumes that gradable adjectives are predicates of events \citep[e.g.,][]{higginbothamschein1989}. Thus, \emph{heavy} predicates over \textsc{heavy} events, \emph{big} over \textsc{big} events, etc. For \citeauthor{schwarzschild2011}, stubbornly distributive predicates are those that require their events to have only single participants. The details are not directly relevant for our purposes; what is relevant is the lexical distinction \citeauthor{schwarzschild2011} and others make between stubbornly distributive and complaisantly collective predicates.}
This explanation suffers two flaws:
First, it hypothesizes a categorical distinction that may not hold; in Expt.~2 we find a gradient of collectivity, with no clear boundary.
Second, it leaves unexplained why some predicates would contain pluralities and others not---is there a deeper explanation in terms of the properties named?
%stating that stubbornly distributive predicates do not compose with pluralities serves merely to describe the phenomenon, not to explain it.
%Something about these predicates, or the properties they name, must determine their behavior in plural predication. The task at hand is to determine what that thing is. 


%Since \cite{link1983}, semanticists have been aware of necessarily distributive predicates like \emph{have blue eyes} or \emph{be a man}.  \ndg{awk} Having blue eyes or being a man are properties that necessarily hold of individuals, hence their mandatory distributivity. But collective size is not such a property, at least not transparently so. There is no conceptual barrier to attributing some size directly to a plurality of individuals. Collective nouns bring this point into focus: if a group of men has blue eyes, then each member must; if a pile of boxes counts as tall, we make no direct claim about individual box heights.
%\ex. \a. The group of men has blue eyes. 
%\b. The pile of boxes is tall.

%\subsection{The role of context in plural predication}


%We have seen that predicates like \textit{heavy} admit both distributive and collective interpretations: \textit{the boxes are heavy} can mean either that each member of some salient set of boxes is heavy (distributive), or that, taken together, the whole set counts as heavy (collective; \citealp{scha1984}). Crucially, the set of boxes may count as collectively heavy even when each individual box counts as light. In such a scenario, distributive and collective interpretations pull apart, suggesting a genuine ambiguity in plural predication.

%Not all predicates are so permissive in their interpretations: \textit{the boxes are big} is said to communicate only about individual box size; the collective interpretation whereby speakers communicate about total set size is claimed to be absent (or at least extremely hard to come by). Other size and shape predicates are said to behave similarly.

%Understanding why (and whether) stubbornly distributive predicates like \emph{big} pattern separately from what we will call ``complaisantly collective'' predicates like \emph{heavy} requires a closer look at the differences between these classes of predicates. 
We suggest that the key underlying notion is the stability or \emph{contextual predictability} of a property when applied to a collection.
\ndg{need to define contextual predictability clearly here. say it's a property of the denotation, not the ambiguous surface form.}
For instance, collective \emph{tall} names the vertical extent of a set of objects, and can vary dramatically with their arrangement.
In contrast, collective \emph{heavy} names the total weight of a set of objects, which doesn't vary with arrangement. 
If the precise arrangement is not in common ground then the collective use of \emph{tall} would be more likely to mislead a listener than that of \emph{heavy} (in contrast, the distributive meaning of each is specified, independent of arrangement). A listener would thus not expect a cooperative speaker to intend the collective meaning of \emph{tall}.
%Many aspects of a predicate's meaning, beyond arrangement, could give rise to similar effects

%One difference between complaisantly collective \emph{heavy} and stubbornly distributive \emph{big} is the contextual predictability of the collective properties they name: the former names a maximally stable and predictable property, collective weight; to change the collective weight of a set, one would have to change the weight of an individual member. In contrast, \emph{big} names a collective property that could change with every new arrangement of the individuals said to hold it. 

%The instability inherent to the collective properties named by stubbornly distributive predicates, instability that we are attuned to given our knowledge of the broader world context (i.e., knowledge of how the properties behave), supplies a ready split between these two classes of predicates. Where a property is less predictable on the basis of context, collective interpretations are noisier---they require more coordination between speakers and listeners to arrive at the same judgments about the property of interest. When coordination fails, miscommunication arises.

%Consider the complaisantly collective predicate \emph{heavy}, which names the property of being heavy. 
%With a plural subject under a collective construal, \emph{heavy} comments on total set weight.  Suppose we encounter a set of boxes piled one on top of the other. Those boxes will have a collective weight, and depending on that weight those boxes may or may not count as collectively heavy. Now, suppose we encounter that same set of boxes, this time lined up one next to the other. Despite changing the physical arrangement of the set of boxes, their weight remains the same.  Collective weight is a stable property of sets. Another complaisantly collective predicate, \emph{voluminous}, behaves similarly: the volume of a set of objects remains unchanged despite varying physical arrangement. So too for \emph{expensive} and any other complaisantly collective gradable predicate: the collective property is regular and predictable on the basis of context; rearranging the members of a plurality has no effect on the collective property itself.

%Next, consider the stubbornly distributive predicate \emph{big}. Unlike with \emph{heavy}, the collective property named by \emph{big} (i.e., collective size) will depend crucially on the physical arrangement of the boxes said to hold it. Suppose we evaluate collective size by determining area in a 2D plane.\footnote{Indeed, there are many ways to evaluate the property of collective size: we could measure the total space some objects take up (including negative space), the volume the objects displace, their total width, their height, etc. This indeterminacy of dimension also contributes to the decreased contextual predictability of collective size.} Collective size does not persist against a changing arrangement of the set of boxes; change the physical arrangement of the set, and you will have changed its collective size. In many cases, for speakers and listeners to arrive at the same judgments about collective size, they need to encounter the same arrangement of objects. The same applies to the other properties named by stubborn distributive predicates, properties of physical extent.

%Here it bears noting that the divide between stubbornly distributive and complaisantly collective predicates might not be so sharp as the comparison between \emph{heavy} and \emph{big} suggests. Take \emph{tall}. The predicate suggests a single, canonical strategy for evaluation: distance from the ground. However, the property does not persist despite changing physical arrangement: changing the arrangement of a set potentially changes its total distance from the ground. Still, encountering a set of boxes, it often feels perfectly felicitous to discuss their collective height using a sentence like \emph{The boxes are tall}. But note that crucial to the collective interpretation of this sentence is a specific and salient physical arrangement of boxes; an abstract set of boxes does not hold the property of being tall, but some specific arrangements of it might.

%We appear to have a continuum of stubborn distributivity, or, perhaps better put, a continuum of collectivity for gradable predicates. At issue is the contextual predictability of the collective property these predicates name, which determines how noisy the collective interpretations will be. Where a property is less predictable on the basis of context, collective interpretations are noisier---they require more coordination between speakers and listeners to arrive at the same judgments about the property of interest. When coordination fails, miscommunication arises. %In other words, our---speakers' and listeners'---judgments about the truth of a collective interpretation might not align for stubbornly distributive predicates if we do not encounter the same arrangement of individuals. 
%Noisy collective interpretations are less useful at communicating the speaker's intended message; they should therefore be less likely. With complaisantly collective predicates, the named properties are maximally predictable and therefore their collective interpretations are minimally noisy. These interpretations are therefore more likely.

Here is the general hypothesis: collective interpretations are susceptible to varying amounts of noise depending on the contextual predictability of the property at issue.
%; less predictable collective properties yield noisier collective interpretations because judgments by speakers and listeners might not align. 
%Language is used to communicate. Speakers aspire toward clarity in this process of communication. 
%With a stubbornly distributive predicate, the property a speaker makes reference to might change depending on the arrangement of the things said to hold it. 
To communicate effectively and avoid possible confusion, collective interpretations will be avoided by speakers in the case of such noisy predicates; distributive interpretations being less variable are the safe bet. 
Listeners know this, hence collective interpretations will become more likely as contextual predictability of the collective property increases.
This would explain the phenomenon of stubborn distributivity in terms of the relative unpredictability of the collective property for predicates like \emph{big}.
It also predicts that context should matter: in a context where the collective property is more stable, the collective reading should be more felicitous.
 
%The introduction of structure into, or the removal of variability from the context of predication should increase the viability of collective interpretations: 
For physical properties, the physical arrangement is a key element of context. If arrangements are less likely to change, collective properties become more predictable, and so collective interpretations become more useful and more likely. 
We test this prediction in Expt.~3, measuring whether the collective \emph{big} and \emph{tall} indeed feel more natural for blocks that are always stacked regularly than for jumbled piles of blocks.
More generally, some types of objects may have more predictable collective properties than others.
This leads to the prediction that the nouns which serve as objects in a plural predication should also affect the likelihood of collective interpretation. \ndg{put an example back here?}
In Expt.~2 we test whether this is the case for a variety of predicates.

%This reasoning underlies the intuition, which we test experimentally, that if sets of boxes always assume the same arrangement (say, they are always stacked on top of each other), suddenly using stubbornly distributive \emph{big} to discuss their collective size feels much more natural.
%Finding such a connection between contextual predictability of collective properties and rates of collective interpretations for stubbornly distributive predicates, we would have evidence that the phenomenon of stubborn distributivity is not a simple lexical distinction, but rather emerges as a result of rational inferences between speakers and listeners as they endeavor to communicate efficiently. %Moreover, given that complaisantly collective predicates name properties that are already maximally predictable, we should not expect to be able to increase the contextual predictability of their collective properties and thereby increase their rates of collective interpretations.
%
%Once we consider the complex interaction between speakers and listeners, we open the door to the influence of context at many levels. We have seen how properties of the broader world context (i.e., contextual predictability of collective properties) might serve to disambiguate between stubbornly distributive and complaisantly collective predicates. We have also encountered, albeit indirectly, the influence of the local linguistic context on this disambiguation: different predicates privilege different interpretations by virtue of the contextual predictability of the properties they name (cf.~\emph{big} vs.~\emph{heavy}). 
%Also at play in the local linguistic context are the nouns that serve as the subjects to these predicates. As with the properties named by  predicates, the objects named by  subject nouns might affect contextual predictability by virtue of how regularly they instantiate in the world. If we could find objects that instantiate in regular physical arrangements (e.g., shelves or waves) or with no physical arrangement at all (e.g., numbers or ideas), we might expect stubbornly distributive predicates to more readily admit collective interpretations when the nouns that name these objects serve as subject. %As with contextual predictability, we test this intuition experimentally below.  

We are arguing for an explanation of plural predication in which ambiguity is resolved by pragmatic reasoning: the usefulness of each reading is determined partly by its contextual predictability, and readings which would be more useful on these grounds are preferred. 
This pragmatic view entails that other standard pragmatic pressures should come to bear, affecting the felicity of the collective (and distributive) interpretation.
To whit, changing the speaker's epistemic state ought to influence the resulting disambiguation between distributive and collective interpretations. 
If a speaker lacks evidence that would verify a specific interpretation, and if a listener knows this about the speaker, then that unsupported interpretation should be particularly improbable. This intuition derives straightforwardly from the Maxim of Quality from \cite{grice1975}: ``Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.'' 
We explore this prediction first in Expt.~1 and then more systematically in Expt.~3.



%%Contextual predictability affects availability of collective interpretations to the extent that speakers and listeners attend to each other as they communicate: unpredictable properties are poor candidates for efficient communication, given the amount of increased coordination they necessitate. Once we start 
%One last level of context remains: the immediate discourse context, specifically properties of the speakers and listeners themselves. As with world and linguistic context, this factor determines not the possible, but the \emph{probable} interpretations of plural predications: 
%
%changing the speaker's epistemic state ought to influence the resulting disambiguation between distributive and collective interpretations. 
%If a speaker lacks evidence that would verify a specific interpretation, and if a listener knows this about the speaker, then that unsupported interpretation should be particularly improbable. This intuition derives straightforwardly from the Maxim of Quality from \cite{grice1975}: ``Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.'' 
%%Imagine that a speaker lifts a set of boxes altogether (not individually), and that a listener sees this. Weight is not a visually assessable property, so the speaker would lack access the individual box weights. If the speaker then tells the listener that the boxes were heavy, the listener ought to be able to reason about the limited epistemic state of the speaker to conclude that the speaker intended a collective interpretation: the speaker lacked information that would verify a distributive interpretation, so he must not have intended it.  
%%Thus, while the predictability of collective weight remains a stable property of the context, we may further privilege collective interpretations by limiting speakers' access to the evidence they would need to verify a distributive interpretation. 
%%Conversely, we may privilege distributive interpretations by highlighting distributive knowledge, for example by watching a speaker pick up boxes one at a time. Like contextual predictability, the influence of speaker knowledge should succeed to the extent that speakers and listeners are reasoning about each other as they use language to communicate. 
%%Note that because properties of physical extent are visually assessable (and therefore accessible), we cannot manipulate speakers' knowledge of them so easily. If a speaker can see the boxes, he can see both their individual sizes and shapes, as well as their collective size and shape. Contrary to the predictions of contextual predictability, here we would expect to find an effect of speaker access to knowledge for complaisantly collective, but not stubbornly distributive predicates.

To test these various predictions concerning the role of context in plural predication, we must first establish a way of studying plural predication experimentally; that is, a way to unambiguously access distributive vs.~collective interpretations. To that end, in Expt.~1, we show that the particles \emph{each} and \emph{together} reliably disambiguate plural predication. %In Expt.~2, we apply this disambiguation method to a broad range of linguistic contexts from naturally-occurring examples of plural predication from corpora. In Expt.~3, we again employ this disambiguation method, this time directly manipulating contextual predictability and speaker access to knowledge.

\section{Experiment 1: Validating the paraphrase methodology}

One way to access interpretations of potentially ambiguous plural predications is to elicit ratings of unambiguous paraphrases. We construct these paraphrases using distributive \emph{each} and collective \emph{together}, as in \Next.

\ex. \label{bare}The boxes were big/heavy/tall.
\a.\label{each} The boxes \textbf{each} were big/heavy/tall.
\b.\label{together} The boxes \textbf{together} were big/heavy/tall.

Although many theorists assume the success of these disambiguating particles \citep[e.g.,][]{schwarzschild1994}, diligence is due: we must establish that these are in fact unambiguous paraphrases in the context of our experimental paradigm. We do so by asking participants to choose between two collections as the referent of each phrase \ref{bare}, \ref{each}, and \ref{together}; the objects in one collection had the property individually (but not collectively), while the other collection had the property (but the individuals in it did not).
We expect the two disambiguated phrases to lead to robust selection of the corresponding collection, while selections for the ambiguous phrase will indicate preferences for its interpretation.
In addition we begin to explore the role of context by manipulating the plausible knowledge of the speaker: whether he is likely to have access to the relevant information about each object, or only about the collection.

\subsection{Participants}

We recruited 50 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing service. Participants were compensated for their participation.


\subsection{Design and methods}

Participants were introduced to Cubert, a worker in a box factory. Between participants, the context scenario either had Cubert ``move'' or ``inspect'' the boxes that he received from a dispenser. In ``move'' scenarios, Cubert appeared with a cart positioned under the dispenser (Fig.~\ref{expt1context}, left); in ``inspect'' scenarios, there was no cart (Fig.~\ref{expt1context}, right). Participants were told that after moving/inspecting a shipment of boxes, Cubert told his friend Dot about the boxes he moved/inspected. Their task was to help Dot decide which boxes Cubert was referring to with his utterance. Participants chose between two sets of boxes, one that implied a collective interpretation of the utterance (five small boxes, Fig.\ \ref{expt1trial}, left) and one that implied a distributive interpretation (two large boxes which were together smaller than the five, Fig.\ \ref{expt1trial}, right).

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=3in]{images/trial2.eps}
	\caption{Example trial from Expt.~1 with the predicate \emph{big} in the ``each'' utterance.}\label{expt1trial}
\end{figure}

 Cubert used three predicates, \emph{big}, \emph{heavy}, and \emph{tall}, in three sentence frames, or utterances: ``bare'' \ref{bare}, ``each'' \ref{each}, and ``together'' \ref{together}. Participants saw each version of each predicate in a random order, completing nine trials. 

\subsection{Predictions}

If \emph{each} and \emph{together} are clear disambiguators for plural predication, we should should find a split in the choice of referent depending on which of these words appears. Encountering distributive \emph{each}, as in \ref{each}, participants should choose the distributive referent (Fig.~\ref{expt1trial}, right); with collective \emph{together}, \ref{together}, participants should choose the collective referent (Fig.~\ref{expt1trial}, left). 

For the potentially ambiguous bare utterances, stubbornly distributive \emph{big} ought to always prefer distributive referents, while complaisantly collective \emph{heavy} should be split. If predicates of size and shape are always stubbornly distributivity, \emph{tall} should pattern with \emph{big}. Given that size and height are visually assessable properties, the scenario manipulation should have no effect on Cubert's epistemic state, and therefore no effect on the resulting interpretations for bare \emph{big} and \emph{tall}. 
%For complaisantly collective \emph{heavy}, we should find higher rates of collective referent choice for the bare utterance. 
However, given that Cubert would need to lift individual boxes to assess their individual weight we should find an effect of scenario for \emph{heavy}: moving all of the boxes (as opposed to inspecting each box) would yield higher rates of collective referent choice; without lifting each box, Cubert would lack the knowledge needed to be justified in using a distributive interpretation.

\subsection{Results}

Results were coded in terms of whether participants chose the collective referent, and therefore the collective interpretation for Cubert's statement to Dot. Fig.\ \ref{results2} displays the proportion of collective choices, with bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals drawn from 10,000 samples of the data \citep{diciccioefron1996}; a value of 1 indicates that participants chose the collective referent 100\% of the time.

To evaluate the disambiguating potential of our paraphrases, we first look at responses to these paraphrases, excluding the bare utterance. Mean proportion of collective referent choice for collective paraphrases with \emph{together} was 85\% (i.e., near ceiling); for distributive paraphrases with \emph{each} this proportion was 10\% (i.e., near floor). We fit a mixed effects logistic regression model \citep{baayenetal2008} using the \emph{lme4} package \citep{batesetal2014} in \emph{R}, predicting referent choice by \textsc{utterance} (``each,'' ``together''), as well as \textsc{trial} order.  The model included random intercepts for participants, predicates, and scenarios, as well as random slopes for participants grouped by \textsc{utterance} (i.e., the maximal random effects structure supported by the data). The full regression model appears in Appendix \ref{expt1results}. The model finds a main effect of \textsc{utterance} ($\beta$ = 5.50, $SE$ = 0.94, $z$ = 5.87, p $<$ 0.001) such that collective \emph{together} yielded greater rates of collective referent choice than distributive \emph{each}; the effect of \textsc{trial} was not significant ($\beta$ = 0.06, $SE$ = 0.08, $z$ = 0.81, p $=$ 0.42). Thus, the ``together'' utterances yielded collective referent choices, and the ``each'' utterances did not.
\ndg{should we have predicate be a predictor here so that we can report (whether) the predicate didn't affect choice for the fully dissambiguated phrases?}

To evaluate the behavior of the predicates in the absence of the disambiguating particles, together with the effect of our scenario manipulation, we next consider responses to the bare, potentially ambiguous utterance. We fit a mixed effects logistic regression model predicting referent choice by \textsc{predicate} (\emph{big}, \emph{heavy}, \emph{tall}), \textsc{scenario} (``move,'' ``inspect''), and \textsc{trial} order. We dummy coded the \textsc{predicate} predictor, with \emph{big} as the reference level. The model included random intercepts and slopes for participants (grouped by \textsc{trial}; the maximal random effects structure supported by the data). The full regression model appears in Appendix \ref{expt1results}. The model finds main effects of \textsc{predicate} for both the \emph{heavy} ($\beta$ = 3.05, $SE$ = 1.23, $z$ = 2.48, p $<$ 0.05) and the \emph{tall} ($\beta$ = 3.63, $SE$ = 1.29, $z$ = 2.82, p $<$ 0.01) contrasts. Compared to \emph{big}, the other predicates yielded greater rates of collective referent choice in ``bare'' utterances. While the effect of \textsc{scenario} did not reach significance, we note the trend in Fig.~\ref{results2} whereby ``move'' scenarios tended to have higher rates of collective referent choice for bare \emph{heavy} utterances (34\% ``move'' vs.~14\% ``inspect''); a post-hoc test of this difference approaches significance ($t$ = -1.70, \emph{df} = 47.96, $p$ = 0.096).

\end{figure}


\subsection{Discussion}

The disambiguating paraphrases behave as expected: \emph{each} delivers a distributive interpretation and \emph{together} delivers a collective one. We also find that the bare form of \emph{big} patterns differently from \emph{heavy} and \emph{tall}---it is more distributive. This finding is expected with respect to \textit{big} vs.~\textit{heavy} (the former should be stubbornly distributive), but surprising given the behavior of \textit{tall}: both \emph{tall} and \emph{big} are predicates of size and shape. If naming properties of physical extent mediates the choice between distributive and collective interpretations of plural predications, we should find that \emph{tall} patterns with \emph{big}. Equally damning is the comparison between \emph{tall} and \emph{heavy}: if anything, \emph{tall} more consistently delivers collective interpretations. What allows \emph{tall} to readily receive collective interpretations---while precluding them for \emph{big}---in our experimental context? 

As discussed above, one candidate factor is the contextual predictability of the collective property: how easy it is for speakers and listeners to arrive at the same collective property for a given set of objects. We have seen that collective weight is a stable property of sets, which stands to explain the complaisance of \emph{heavy} toward collective interpretations. In the context of the current experiment, collective height is also predictable: boxes  always appeared stacked one on top of the other, yielding stable total set heights. Collective size, however, could vary depending on the strategy used to evaluate it (height? width? area? volume?) as well as on the arrangement of the objects said to hold it, thus accounting for the lack of collective interpretations for bare \emph{big}. In Expt.~3, we use the paraphrase methodology to directly investigate the role of contextual predictability in plural predication.

The results of the current experiment do not rule out a role of speaker knowledge in plural predication: based solely on whether the context scenario had Cubert move vs.~inspect the boxes he received, we see a trend whereby bare \emph{heavy} received more or less collective interpretations, respectively. The absence of the effect for \emph{big} and \emph{tall} suggests an explanation in terms of the epistemic state of the speaker: in ``move'' scenarios, the speaker is less likely to have access to individual box weights; the listener is therefore less likely to assume that the speaker, Cubert, intended a distributive interpretation for which he lacks evidence. We attempt to confirm this effect with a similar scenario manipulation in Expt.~3.

But before we manipulate contextual predictability and speaker knowledge directly, we extend the paraphrase methodology in Expt.~2 to naturally-occurring examples of plural predication, investigating the role of the local linguistic context.


\section{Experiment 2: Naturally-occurring examples}

In Expt.~1, we used a reference task to validate disambiguating paraphrases as a probe of interpretations of plural predications. 
We next use the paraphrase methodology to evaluate natural plural predications gathered from corpora. We aim to both extend our understanding of distributive vs.~collective preferences to predicates beyond \emph{big/tall/heavy}, and explore the effect of linguistic context: how the head noun affects this preference.
\ndg{better motivate: we want to see whether there is a clear distinction among predicate classes, we want to see whether noun affects interpretation, etc}

%However, by providing potential referents, we gave participants specific and salient physical arrangements (e.g., box stacks) against which to evaluate interpretations of predicates. Here, we move away from specific arrangements and use the disambiguating paraphrases from Expt.~1 to directly probe interpretations of plural predications.
%We extend beyond big/tall/heavy boxes, to look at frequent linguistic contexts for plural predication. Doing so provides insight into the role the local linguistic context plays in the disambiguation of plural predication.

\subsection{Experiment 2a: Frequent plural predications}

 We begin with naturally-occurring examples of plural predications extracted from the British National Corpus.\footnote{Sentences were extracted from the British National Corpus Online service, managed by Oxford University Computing Services on behalf of the BNC Consortium. All rights in the texts cited are reserved.}

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited 90 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk. Participants were compensated for participation.

\subsubsection{Design and methods}

In a search of the British National Corpus, we identified the 40 most frequent subject-predicate combinations in the plural predication frame in \Next.

\ex. The \textsc{noun}s were \textsc{adjective}.

Each participant was presented with 30 sentences; 15 of these sentences were drawn randomly \ndg{was it random?} from the original set of the 40 most frequent instances. The other 15 sentences were constructed by randomly pairing subjects and predicates from the original set of 40 to create novel sentences. \ndg{were there any restrictions? eg could a participant see the same predicate / subject twice? were the constructed sentences really random for each participant, or was there a fixed set of them?}

Each sentence was presented as an utterance by a speaker, and participants were tasked with determining what the speaker meant. Participants rated two possible paraphrases on a sliding scale. The paraphrases were either distributive (with ``each'', \ref{bnc-each}) and collective (with ``together'', \ref{bnc-together}). 

\ex. \a. The \textsc{noun}s each were \textsc{adjective}. \label{bnc-each}
\b. The \textsc{noun}s together were \textsc{adjective}. \label{bnc-together}

Scale endpoints corresponded to whether the paraphrase was ``definitely'' or ``definitely not'' what the speaker intended by his or her utterance. Before rating its paraphrases, participants judged whether the utterance made sense (choosing between "Yes" and "No"). 

%\subsubsection{Predictions}
%
%Our primary goal is to evaluate the viability of our paraphrase methodology with endorsement ratings. If participants understand our task and fully use the sliders to indicate their preferences, we should see a range of paraphrase endorsement ratings. Additionally, if the interpretations of plural predications depend on the immediate linguistic context---that is, on the subjects and predicates involved---we should find by-noun and by-predicate variation in distributive vs.~collective interpretation rates.

\subsubsection{Results}

\ndg{give some stats on the 'makes sense' judgements: of the original sentences, what was the mean percent sensible? range? for the constructed sentences?}
In the analyses reported below, we only look at responses to utterances that participants said made sense. \ndg{why?}

We begin with a look at the range of collective endorsement ratings.\footnote{A look at distributive endorsement ratings, or normalized collective ratings (i.e., the difference between collective and distributive ratings) reveals similar patterns of results.} Fig.~\ref{sentence-coll} plots average collective endorsement ratings for each of the 40 most frequent sentences.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.985\linewidth]{plots/sentence_plot2.eps}
	%\vspace{0pt}
	\caption{Collective paraphrase endorsement rates for different noun-predicate combinations in Expt.~2a (i.e., for different sentences).} \label{sentence-coll}
\end{figure}

Descriptively, we see a wide range of ratings, spanning from approximately 25\%  to 85\% endorsement; participants appear to be comfortable using the full scale. An important observation about the distribution of ratings in Fig.~\ref{sentence-coll} is its relatively smooth gradient: we fail to find clear groupings of predicates, such that they behave in one way or another with respect to collective interpretations. Stubbornly distributive \emph{small} indeed occurs toward the low end of collective endorsement ratings, but not markedly so.

There are 8 predicates that occur with different subject nouns in our small corpus; we plot their average collective endorsement ratings in Fig.~\ref{noun-pred-coll}.
%
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.85\linewidth]{plots/noun_pred_plot2.eps}
	%\vspace{0pt}
	\caption{Collective paraphrase endorsement rates for different subject nouns grouped by predicate (Expt.~2a).} \label{noun-pred-coll}
\end{figure}
%
Rates of collective endorsement differ by subject noun for one and the same predicate. We draw the reader's attention to the case of stubbornly distributive \emph{small} (bottom right). 
If stubborn distributivity were a binary, predicate-level phenomenon hard-coded into the semantics of these predicates, we should find no effect of the subject noun in the determination of their distributive vs.~collective interpretations: stubbornly distributive predicates, regardless of their subject, should always be maximally distributive. But as \emph{small} in Fig.~\ref{noun-pred-coll} demonstrates, they are not. 
%More importantly, the subject \emph{numbers} stands out in its relatively high rates of collective endorsement with the predicate \emph{small}. 
A linear mixed effects model predicting collective endorsement rates by subject noun for \emph{small}, with random by-participant intercepts, finds that sentences with the subject \emph{numbers} received greater rates of collective endorsement than sentences with \emph{children} ($\beta=-0.15$, $SE=0.07$, $t=-2.24$, $p<0.05$), \emph{rooms} ($\beta=-0.19$, $SE=0.07$, $t=-2.73$, $p<0.01$), or \emph{classes} ($\beta=-0.27$, $SE=0.07$, $t=-3.87$, $p<0.01$).\footnote{We find the same pattern of results if instead we compare each subject noun with the grand mean (i.e., through effect, or deviation, coding of our variables): \emph{numbers} deviates significantly, while the other nouns do not.}

\ndg{we should have some analysis of the other seven predicates -- maybe there is an overall test of whether noun matters? or do tests within predicates (add significance stars to the figure...).}

%\subsubsection{Discussion}

\subsection{Experiment 2b: \emph{big}, \emph{heavy}, \emph{tall}}

The three predicates \emph{big}, \emph{heavy}, and \emph{tall} are of particular interest because they come from both supposed lexical categories (stubborn and complaisant), while lending themselves to direct manipulation (as in Expt.~1) because they depend on physical properties.
Due to the limited number of instances of plural predication with these predicates in the British National Corpus, we use instead the much larger Google Books Corpus \citep{davies2011} to look at them in more detail.

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited 30 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk. Participants were compensated for participation.

\subsubsection{Design and methods}

The design and methods for this experiment were identical to those of Expt.~2a, with the exception that our naturally-occurring examples feature the predicates \emph{big}, \emph{heavy}, and \emph{tall}, and derive from the Google Books Corpus. We identified the five most frequent subject nouns in the plural predication frame (i.e., \emph{the \textsc{noun}s were \textsc{adjective}}) for each of the predicates \emph{big}, \emph{heavy}, and \emph{tall}.\footnote{For \emph{heavy}, many of the most frequent subject nouns resulted in a non-canonical, abstract interpretation. For example, \emph{heavy rains} or \emph{heavy casualties}. We excluded these cases from the current experiment. In a separate experiment, we included just these abstract instances of plural predication with \emph{heavy} and found no effect of the subject noun on interpretation.} The subject-predicate pairs appear in \Next.

\ex. \emph{Noun-predicate pairings}:\\[2pt]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
big:& boys, children, houses, rooms, waves\\
heavy:& bags, lids, loads, men, trees\\
tall:& buildings, offspring, plants, trees, windows
\end{tabular}	

As with Expt.~2a, participants judged whether the resulting sentences made sense and rated disambiguating paraphrases of each. 

%\subsubsection{Predictions}
%
%\ndg{i don't think we need this section. move any relevant motivation to start of expt....}
%
%Given that \emph{heavy} has been described as complaisantly collective, we should find greater rates of collective interpretation endorsements for this predicate. For stubbornly distributive \emph{big}, we should find much lower rates of collective interpretations. If the relatively high rates of collective interpretations for \emph{tall} in Expt.~1 stemmed from the availability of a specific physical arrangement, we should find lower rates of collective interpretation here, where no arrangements are specified.
%
%If contextual predictability influences the visibility and thus viability of collective interpretations, we should find that noun-predicate pairs that plausibly implicate contextually predictable collective properties---as was the case with \emph{small numbers} in Expt.~2a---yield greater rates of collective interpretations. For example, with \emph{big waves}, the physical instantiation of waves is likely more regular than that of, say, buildings or plants. We might therefore expect greater rates of collective interpretations for \emph{big waves} compared to the other sentences with \emph{big}.
%
%We might also expect to find variation by subject noun that tracks speakers' access to knowledge. That is, if a speaker is more likely to lack evidence for a distributive or a collective interpretation for a specific noun-predicate pair, we should find greater rates of the competing interpretations for that pair. For example, with \emph{heavy loads}, it is unlikely that the speaker carried all of the loads together, so the speaker would lack direct access to knowledge about the collective weight of those loads; we would therefore expect lower rates of collective interpretations as the probability of epistemic access to total, collective weight decreases.

\subsubsection{Results}

We again look only at responses to the utterances that participants indicated made sense to them. \ndg{again, why?}

\ndg{here, but also in other expts, should do some analysis of the distributive paraphrase... it's weird to just leave it out. if it is truly redundant with the collective measure, how about quantifying that? ie. report their correlation or such.}

Fig.~\ref{bhtcoll} plots average collective endorsement ratings for each of the three predicates grouped by their subjects.

	\caption{Collective paraphrase endorsement rates for different nouns serving as the subject to the predicates \emph{big}, \emph{heavy}, and \emph{tall} (Expt.~2b).} \label{bhtcoll}
\end{figure}
%
To compare the predicates with each other, we fit a linear mixed effects model predicting collective endorsement by predicate, with random intercepts for participants and nouns, and random slopes for participants. The predicate predictor was dummy coded with \emph{heavy} as the reference level. There were main effects for both contrasts, such that \emph{big} ($\beta=-0.22$, $SE=0.07$, $t=-3.24$, $p<0.01$) and \emph{tall} ($\beta=-0.20$, $SE=0.06$, $t=-3.20$, $p<0.01$) led to lower rates of collective endorsement. Next, we examine the behavior of the subject nouns for each predicate in turn.

\ndg{it's not clear to me that the ensuing are the most useful analyses to do... we want to know how judgements vary by noun. it is relevant to know if any nouns differ within predicate, and also whether the ranges of the predicates overlap....}

Starting with \emph{tall}, we fit a linear mixed effects model predicting collective endorsement by subject noun, with random intercepts for participants and nouns, and random slopes for participants. The subject noun predictor was dummy coded with \emph{trees} as the reference level (i.e., the subject with the highest average collective endorsement rating). Compared to \emph{trees}, we do not find an effect of the contrast with \emph{plants} ($\beta=0.00$, $SE=0.06$, $t=-0.07$, $p=0.95$), \emph{offspring} ($\beta=-0.03$, $SE=0.06$, $t=-0.55$, $p=0.59$), \emph{buildings} ($\beta=-0.06$, $SE=0.06$, $t=-1.00$, $p=0.32$), or \emph{windows} ($\beta=-0.09$, $SE=0.06$, $t=-1.52$, $p=0.13$). In other words, \emph{tall}'s subjects behave similarly in their general resistance to collective interpretation. 

Turning to \emph{big}, we performed a similar analysis, this time dummy coding \emph{waves} (the subject with the greatest average collective endorsement rating) as the reference level. There were significant effects of each contrast: \emph{rooms} ($\beta=-0.18$, $SE=0.06$, $t=-2.97$, $p<0.01$), \emph{boys} ($\beta=-0.22$, $SE=0.06$, $t=-3.53$, $p<0.01$), \emph{children} ($\beta=-0.21$, $SE=0.06$, $t=-3.54$, $p<0.01$), and \emph{houses} ($\beta=-0.23$, $SE=0.06$, $t=-3.68$, $p<0.01$); \emph{waves} stands out in its relatively high levels of collective endorsement with \emph{big}.

Finally, \emph{heavy}; here, \emph{bags} received the highest collective endorsement ratings, so we coded it as the reference level. The contrast with \emph{lids} was not significant ($\beta=-0.08$, $SE=0.08$, $t=-1.04$, $p=0.30$), the contrast with \emph{trees} was marginally significant ($\beta=-0.15$, $SE=0.08$, $t=-1.93$, $p=0.06$), and the contrasts with \emph{loads} ($\beta=-0.24$, $SE=0.08$, $t=-3.15$, $p<0.01$) and \emph{men} ($\beta=-0.25$, $SE=0.08$, $t=-3.56$, $p<0.01$) were significant. In other words, we find similarly high ratings for \emph{bags} and \emph{lids}, intermediate ratings for \emph{trees}, and similarly low ratings for \emph{loads} and \emph{men}.

\subsubsection{Discussion}

\ndg{to edit...}

We have extended our paraphrase methodology beyond a simple reference task, using naturally-occurring examples of plural predications.
% Our goals here were modest: to understand better the terrain of interpretation preferences for plural predications, without special attention to particular classes of predicates or subjects. Participants demonstrated full use of the paraphrase endorsement rating scales provided. Moreover, 
The pattern of ratings sheds some light on the interpretation of plural predication. Perhaps most obvious is the absence of clear groups of predicates: one would be hard-pressed to read stubborn distributivity (or complaisant collectivity) off the gradient of ratings in Fig.~\ref{sentence-coll}.

The fact that disambiguation preferences differ by subject noun, not only by predicate further shifts the theoretical focus from lexical classes of predicates. If a plural predication can be more or less collective depending on the subject, then we must look at least partly to context in order to understand interpretation preferences.

%After considering the full set of sentences, we narrowed our focus to those predicates occurring in more than one sentence (i.e., with different subject nouns). Narrower still, 

We highlighted the case of stubbornly distributive \emph{small}, showing that the subject \emph{numbers} yielded higher rates of collective endorsement than other subject nouns. One possible explanation for the exceptional behavior of \emph{numbers} is thus: The collective size of numbers is naturally their sum, 
%Faced with the task of evaluating the relative size of a hypothetical set of numbers, participants converge on a single strategy, namely summing them up. In other words, the collective size of numbers 
which is relatively predictable in context---more so than the collective size of children (determined by, e.g., height, weight, age, etc.) or of rooms and classes (determined by, e.g., number of occupants, seating capacity, overall volume, etc.). Moreover, numbers do not physically instantiate, so the contextual predictability of their collective size will not suffer from potential variability in their arrangement. 
We explore this idea further in Expt.~2b, focussing on the theoretically relevant set of predicates: \emph{big}, \emph{heavy}, and \emph{tall}. \ndg{why?}

\ndg{other discussion begins here}

As expected given its status as complaisantly collective, \emph{heavy} yields greater rates of collective paraphrase endorsement. Stubbornly distributive \emph{big} and \emph{tall} pattern together in their resistance to collective interpretations. This finding for \emph{big} aligns with the finding from Expt.~1, where we found a  similar pattern of stubborn distributivity for \emph{big}. For \emph{tall}, however, this finding is at odds with the relatively high rate of acceptance for collective interpretations participants demonstrated in Expt.~1.

We interpret this finding for \emph{tall} as evidence for the context-dependent nature of these predications. In Expt.~1, participants had specific, salient sets against which to evaluate the property. In the current experiment, this information was lacking, and so were collective interpretations. In other words, without information about how the subject physically instantiates, participants are wary of assigning collective interpretations to predicates of physical extent. Here we again find evidence for the role of contextual predictability of the relevant property in the disambiguation of plural predications: in Expt.~1, collective height was particularly salient (boxes came stacked on top of each other); here, collective height was underspecified (it would depend on the specific physical arrangement of the subject in question).

We find additional evidence for the role of contextual predictability in the results for the predicate \emph{big}. As predicted, four out of the five subject nouns strongly resisted collective interpretations. However, with \emph{waves}, participants much more readily endorsed collective paraphrases. As was the case with \emph{small numbers} in Expt.~2a, this finding suggests that limiting the noise of a collective interpretation---by reducing the variability in the physical instantiation of the subject---increases the rates of that interpretation. We follow up on these findings concerning the role of contextual predictability and noise in interpretation with a direct manipulation of predictability in Expt.~3.

Finally, with \emph{heavy}, we found that different subject nouns yielded different rates of collective interpretations. At first blush, these differences appear to track the probability that a speaker would have access to the information necessary to verify a collective interpretation. Lids and bags are probably picked up together, certainly more so than trees, and yet more so than loads or men. Without experiencing the collective weight of a plurality (e.g., of many loads), speakers lack knowledge about whether or not a collective interpretation would be true (e.g., what the total weight of the loads was); without this knowledge, the interpretation becomes less likely, and as a result its alternative, the distributive interpretation, becomes more likely. As with contextual predictability, we follow up on this result with a direct manipulation of speaker access to knowledge in Expt.~3.


\section{Experiment 3: Manipulating context}

If physical arrangements are less likely to change, collective properties become more predictable. And with more predictable collective properties, the truth values of statements involving them become more stable, so collective interpretations are less noisy and stand a better chance of being informative. These interpretations should therefore become more likely. If speakers lack knowledge to verify one of two possible interpretations, the epistemically-supported interpretation should become more likely. In Expt.~3, we manipulated predictability and speakers' access to knowledge through a series of context scenarios, and used the paraphrase endorsement method from Expt.~1 to test the availability of collective interpretations.

\subsection{Participants}

We recruited 80 participants through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Participants were compensated for participation.

\subsection{Design and methods}

The experimental context was similar to that of Expt.~1. Participants were first introduced to an agent, Cubert, who works in a factory with boxes. Cubert receives boxes from a dispenser in the ceiling. Participants began by observing the dispenser in action.

Between subjects, we manipulated the \textsc{scenario} story (``move'' vs.~``inspect''): Cubert's job was either to move shipments of boxes, or to inspect them. As in Expt.~1, in ``move'' scenarios, Cubert appeared with a dolly with which to carry the boxes. In ``inspect'' scenarios, Cubert appeared without a dolly.

Also between subjects, we manipulated the variability of the \textsc{context} (``regular'' vs.~``random''). In regular contexts, the dispenser consistently stacked boxes on top of each other (Fig.~\ref{expt2context}, left). In random contexts, boxes were dispensed without any consistent physical arrangement (Fig.\ \ref{expt2context}, right). Participants saw four each of either ``regular'' or ``random'' context priming scenarios.

\ndg{do the boxes vary at all in the familiarization aside from arrangement? if so describe.}

After observing the dispenser in action via the context  scenarios, participants were then introduced to a second agent, Dot, whom Cubert told about some boxes he moved/inspected. Participants were tasked with helping Dot understand what Cubert meant by his utterance. To do so, they saw an utterance and rated potential paraphrases on a sliding scale. The paraphrases were either distributive (with  ``each'') or collective (with ``together'').  Scale endpoints corresponded to whether the paraphrase was ``definitely'' or ``definitely not'' what Cubert meant by his utterance (Fig. \ref{trial}). (Note that, unlike Expt.~1, there was no explicit referent of the utterance visible.) Participants completed three trials in a random order with three different predicates: \emph{big}, \emph{heavy}, and \emph{tall}.

\subsection{Predictions}

\ndg{i don't think we need this section. relevant motivation can go at beginning of this section. it'll be more compact that way. altermatively, make it shorter and more specific (we predict an interaction between blah and blah, etc).}

If contextual predictability of collective properties influences the availability of collective interpretations, we should find that regular arrangement contexts yield more collective interpretations, resulting in higher endorsement rates for the collective paraphrase with \emph{together}. This effect ought to hold for the predicates \emph{big} and \emph{tall}---\emph{heavy} is already strongly contextually predictable, so we might not be able to increase its predictability. The predicate \emph{tall} should be the most sensitive to our context manipulation because we introduce regularity into its dimension of measurement directly: stacking boxes on top of each other to make collective height particularly salient.

Given the trending effect of speaker access to knowledge with \emph{heavy} in Expt.~1---where ``move'' scenarios dis-privileged distributive knowledge and therefore had greater rates of collective interpretations---and the significant effect with \emph{heavy}'s subject nouns in Expt.~2---where collective interpretations appeared to increase as probability of collective knowledge increased---we should find a similar effect here: collective paraphrase endorsement for \emph{heavy} should be greater in ``move'' scenarios where distributive knowledge is lacking, independent of the regularity of the context. We have no reason to expect a similar effect for the other two predicates, due to the visual assessability of their corresponding properties, and their insensitivity to the scenario manipulation in Expt.~1.

\subsection{Results}

Fig.\ \ref{resultsexpt2} displays the raw paraphrase endorsement ratings averaged across all trials with bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals. For the purpose of analysis, we analyze responses to the collective paraphrases (i.e., the red bars in Fig.~\ref{resultsexpt2}); higher rates of endorsement for the collective paraphrase signal greater rates of collective interpretation.\footnote{All reported results hold if instead we look at normalized collective paraphrase endorsement ratings (i.e., the difference between collective and distributive endorsements for each trial).} %calculated the difference between collective and distributive paraphrase endorsement ratings for each trial; Fig.~\ref{normresultsexpt2} presents these difference scores, where greater values of the difference score signal greater rates of collective paraphrase endorsement.

\end{figure}


We fit a linear mixed effects model predicting collective endorsement ratings by \textsc{context} (``random'' vs.~``regular''),
\textsc{predicate} (\emph{big}, \emph{heavy}, \emph{tall}; with \emph{big} dummy-coded as the reference level),
 \textsc{scenario} (``inspect'' vs.~``move''), and \textsc{trial} order; the model included interactions between \textsc{predicate} and \textsc{context}, and between \textsc{predicate} and \textsc{scenario}. The model also included random intercepts for participants, as well as random slopes for participants grouped by \textsc{trial} (i.e., the maximal random effects structure supported by the data). The full regression model appears in Appendix \ref{expt2results}.

As apparent in Fig.~\ref{resultsexpt2}, there was a main effect of \textsc{context}, so that regular contexts had more collective interpretations than did random contexts ($\beta$ = 0.18, $SE$ = 0.07, $t$ = 2.70, p $<$ 0.01). The model finds a main effect of the contrast between \emph{big} and \emph{tall} ($\beta$ = 0.07, $SE$ = 0.04, $t$ = 2.00, p $<$ 0.05), driven in large part by a marginally significant interaction between \emph{tall} and \textsc{context} ($\beta$ = 0.13, $SE$ = 0.08, $t$ = 1.72, p $=$ 0.09): \emph{tall} was most affected by our contextual manipulation, yielding the greatest rates of collective interpretations in regular contexts. Finally, the model finds a significant interaction between the predicate \emph{heavy} and \textsc{scenario} ($\beta$ = 0.21, $SE$ = 0.08, $t$ = 2.77, p $<$ 0.01): \emph{heavy} received more collective interpretations in ``move'' scenarios.

\subsection{Discussion}

As we would expect if contextual predictability of collective properties influences the viability of collective interpretations, regular contexts had higher ratings for collective paraphrases (and lower ratings for distributive ones). The predicate \textit{tall} was most affected by our contextual manipulation, which directly targeted the height dimension, stacking boxes on top of each other. But \emph{big}, claimed to be stubbornly distributive, is similarly affected: regular contexts yield more collective interpretations. 

For the predicate \emph{heavy}, most striking is its sensitivity to the ``move'' vs.~``inspect'' scenario manipulation: as was the trend in the results of Expt.~1, ``move'' scenarios yielded much greater collective endorsement ratings for \emph{heavy}. This manipulation privileges collective interpretations by limiting speakers' access to the information they would need to verify a distributive interpretation; Cubert lacked access to individual box weights in ``move'' scenarios. The predicates \emph{big} and \emph{tall} were not affected by the speaker knowledge scenario manipulation, presumably because they name properties that are visually assessable, and thus visually accessible.

An outstanding issue that warrants comment concerns the effect of our contextual predictability manipulation. We identified as regular, high-predictability contexts those in which the box dispenser consistently stacked Cubert's boxes. By regularizing the physical arrangement of the relevant sets, we increased the contextual predictability of the collective properties of physical extent named by \emph{big} and \emph{tall}. This increased contextual predictability led to increased collective paraphrase endorsement. However, one might interpret this result differently: in regular, stacked contexts, participants reanalyzed the plural definite description \emph{the boxes} as referring to a single individual (e.g., to a single pile, and not to a set of boxes). And if \emph{the boxes} referred to a single individual, there never was any collective predication.

In addition to the host of issues such a representational coercion story raises for the semantics of plural definite descriptions \citep[for discussion, see ][]{link1983,landman1989,schwarzschild1996,link1998}, the success of our speaker knowledge manipulation speaks directly against it: participants give similarly high distributive endorsement ratings for \emph{heavy} in ``inspect'' scenarios and similarly low distributive endorsement ratings for \emph{heavy} in ``move'' scenarios, regardless of the variability of context. In other words, the speaker knowledge manipulation, which suppresses information about individual set members in ``move'' scenarios, affects random and regular contexts similarly. If regular contexts forced reanalysis of \emph{the boxes} as an assemblage like \emph{the pile}, we would not expect ``move'' vs.~``inspect'' scenarios to privilege or dis-privilege access to information about individual set members; there would only be a single individual available in context.

Taken together, our results demonstrate the central role of context in plural predication: as collective properties become more predictable, collective interpretations become more likely; and without epistemic support, distributive interpretations become less likely. These findings support a pragmatic, information-theoretic account of stubborn distributivity according to which ostensibly stubbornly distributive predicates are such because the properties they name are unpredictable, or unstable in context. Next, we formalize the role of context in this choice of interpretation using a Bayesian Rational Speech-Act model \citep{frankgoodman2012,lassitergoodman2013}. Noisy (i.e., more variable) interpretations are less useful because they require more coordination between speakers and listeners; they are therefore less likely. Similarly, listeners are less likely to assume interpretations for which speakers lack knowledge.



\section{Modeling plural predication}

We have seen that disambiguating plural predication depends not only on local linguistic context (e.g., the predicate, its subject, and disambiguating particles like \emph{each} or \emph{together}), but also on the broader discourse and world context. Moreover, we showed how properties of the broader context stand to explain the effect certain predicates have on disambiguating plural predication: complaisantly collective predicates like \emph{heavy} name collective properties that are stable and predictable on the basis of context; stubbornly distributive predicates like \emph{big} name collective properties that are unstable and unpredictable on the basis of context. The less predictable the collective property, the noisier the collective interpretation. Conversely, we saw that increasing contextual predictability increases collective interpretations, presumably by decreasing potential interpretation noise. A noisy interpretation is less useful at communicating its intended message, and therefore less likely. Additionally, we saw that listeners track speaker knowledge as they disambiguate plural predication, so that unsupported interpretations are unlikely. To formalize the effect of context (i.e., contextual predictability and speaker access to knowledge) in plural predication, we adopt a lifted variable variant of the Bayesian Rational Speech-Act model. 

The Rational Speech-Act (RSA) framework views communication as recursive reasoning between a speaker and a listener. The listener interprets the speaker's utterance by reasoning about a cooperative speaker trying to inform a naive listener about some state of affairs. Using Bayesian inference, the listener determines what the state of the world is likely to be given that a speaker produced some utterance, knowing that the speaker is reasoning about how a listener is most likely to interpret that utterance. Thus, we have at least three levels of inference. At the top, the sophisticated, pragmatic listener, \emph{L}$_{1}$, reasons about the pragmatic speaker, \emph{S}$_{1}$, and infers the state of the world \emph{s} given that the speaker chose to produce the utterance \emph{u}. The speaker chooses \emph{u} by maximizing the probability that a naive, literal listener, \emph{L}$_{0}$, would correctly infer the state of the world \emph{s} given the literal meaning of \emph{u}.

In more detail, the pragmatic listener \emph{L}$_{1}$ computes the probability of a state \emph{s} given some utterance \emph{u}. By reasoning about the speaker \emph{S}$_{1}$, this probability is proportional to the probability that \emph{S}$_{1}$ would choose to utter \emph{u} to communicate about the state \emph{s}, together with the prior probability of the state \emph{s}.

\ex. \emph{The pragmatic listener}:\\
$P_{L_{1}}(s|u) \propto P_{S_{1}}(u|s) \cdot P(s)$

The speaker \emph{S}$_{1}$ desires to choose an utterance \emph{u} that would most effectively communicate some state \emph{s} to a hypothesized literal listener \emph{L}$_{0}$.  In other words, \emph{S}$_{1}$ wants to minimize the effort \emph{L}$_{0}$ would need to arrive at \emph{s} from \emph{u}, all while being efficient at communicating. This trade-off between efficacy and efficiency is not trivial: speakers could always use minimal ambiguity, but unambiguous utterances tend toward the unwieldy, and, very often, unnecessary. \emph{S}$_{1}$ thus seeks to minimize the surprisal of \emph{s} given \emph{u} for the literal listener \emph{L}$_{0}$, while bearing in mind the utterance cost, \emph{C}(\emph{u}). In \Next, we formalize the speaker's utility function \emph{U}$_{S_{1}}$: utterances are more useful at communicating about some state as surprisal and utterance cost decrease.

\ex. \emph{The speaker's utility function}:\\
$U_{S_{1}}(u;s) = \textrm{log}(L_{0}(s|u)) - C(u)$

%With this utility function in mind, 
$S_{1}$ computes the probability of an utterance $u$ given some state $s$ in proportion to the speaker's utility function $U_{S_{1}}$. In other words, $S_{1}$ chooses an utterance in proportion to its utility. The term \mbox{$\alpha > 0$} controls the speaker's optimality, that is, the speaker's rationality in choosing utterances. ($\alpha$ corresponds to the temperature parameter of $S_{1}$'s soft-max optimization.)

\ex. \emph{The pragmatic speaker}:\\
$P_{S_{1}}(u|s) \propto \textrm{exp}(\alpha[\textrm{log}(L_{0}(s|u)) - C(u)])$

At the base of this reasoning, the naive, literal listener $L_{0}$ interprets an utterance according to its meaning. That is, $L_{0}$ computes the probability of $s$ given $u$ according to the semantics of $u$ and the prior probability of $s$. A standard view of the semantic content of an utterance suffices: a mapping from states of the world to truth values.

\ex. \emph{The literal listener}:\\
$P_{L_{0}}(s|u) \propto \sem{u}(s) \cdot P(s)$

Within the RSA framework, communication is thus modeled as in Fig.~\ref{RSA}, where $L_{1}$ reasons about $S_{1}$'s reasoning about a hypothetical $L_{0}$.

In its initial formulation, \citet{frankgoodman2012} use the basic RSA framework to model referent choice in efficient communication. To see the mechanism at work, imagine a referential communication game with three objects, as in Fig.~\ref{refgame}. Suppose a speaker wants to signal an object, but only has a single word with which to do so.
Applying the RSA model schematized in Fig.~\ref{RSA} to the communication scenario in Fig.~\ref{refgame}, the speaker $S_{1}$ chooses a word $u$ to best signal an object $s$ to a literal listener $L_{0}$, who interprets $u$ in proportion to the prior probability of naming objects in the scenario (i.e., to an object's salience, $P(s)$). The pragmatic listener $L_{1}$ reasons about the speaker's reasoning, and interprets $u$ accordingly.  By formalizing the contributions of salience and  efficiency, the RSA framework provides an information-theoretic definition of informativeness in pragmatic inference. This definition will prove crucial in understanding the contribution of contextual predictability of collective properties in the interpretation of plural predication.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{Example referential communication scenario from \citet{frankgoodman2012}. Speakers choose a single word, $u$, to signal an object, $s$.}\label{refgame}
\end{figure}

Continuing with the language game in Fig.~\ref{refgame}, suppose you are the speaker and you want to signal the object in the center to a listener. Your options for $u$ are the words ``blue'' and ``circle''. The clear intuition is to say ``circle,'' and the reasoning behind that intuition readily generalizes: for any utterance you could use, the probability that you pick it to refer to the intended object is inversely proportional to its probability of referring to some other distractor object. We can measure these probabilities for any lexical item in any context, and using the basic RSA model derive quantitative predictions about gradient behavior in human communication. Reason about this reasoning, and you model listener behavior: given that a speaker chose to utter ``circle,'' what object was most likely the intended referent (i.e., the intended meaning)?  %By varying individual features of the objects in visual arrays such as that in Fig.~\ref{refgame}, \citeauthor{frankgoodman2012}

To successfully model ambiguity resolution in plural predication, we need to adopt a variant of the RSA approach wherein speakers and listeners reason not merely over utterances and meanings, but also over variables that contribute to those meanings. This sort of joint-inference ``lifted variable'' (sometimes called ``lexical uncertainty'') RSA model has proven useful in accounts of adjective semantics (where the lifted variable is the adjective's degree threshold; \citealp{lassitergoodman2013}), modal semantics (where the lifted variable is again a threshold, this time for the probability of an event's occurrence; \citealp{lassitergoodman2015}), specificity implicatures (where the lifted variable determines the choice of lexica; \citealp{bergenetal2012}), and non-literal meaning (where the lifted variable concerns the dimension along which the speaker intends to communicate, or the question under discussion; \citealp{kaoetal2014}), to name just a few applications (see also XXX). In our model, the lifted variable about which speakers and listeners reason determines the interpretation of an ambiguous plural predication: whether an utterance is interpreted collectively or distributively.

The ambiguity-resolving free variable $V$ determines the interpretation of a plural predication utterance $u$. When $V$ is \textsc{collective}, $u$ receives a collective interpretation; when $V$ is \textsc{distributive}, $u$ receives a distributive interpretation. Now, the lifted variable literal listener $L_{0}$ computes the probability of some state $s$ given an utterance $u$ and some value for $V$. 

\ex. \emph{The lifted variable literal listener}:\\
$P_{L_{0}}(s|u,V) \propto \sem{u}^{V}(s) \cdot P(s) \cdot P(V)$

But $L_{0}$ does not know the value of $V$. Put differently, the literal listener does not know the intended interpretation of an ambiguous utterance. The name "lifted variable RSA" captures the fact that this free variable gets passed up from the literal listener through the speaker to be estimated by the pragmatic listener; the pragmatic listener fixes the interpretation by which the literal listener interprets the utterance.

The lifted variable pragmatic speaker $S_{1}$ now incorporates $V$ so that utterances are chosen to best communicate some state $s$ given an interpretation $V$. $S_{1}$ maximizes the likelihood of $u$ given $s$ and $V$, relative to the speaker utility function which minimizes surprisal and the cost of $u$.

\ex. \emph{The lifted variable speaker's utility function}:\\
$U_{S_{1}}(u;s,V) = \textrm{log}(L_{0}(s|u,V)) - C(u)$

\ex. \emph{The lifted variable pragmatic speaker}:\\
$P_{S_{1}}(u|s,V) \propto \textrm{exp}(\alpha U_{S_{1}}\!(u;s,V))$

At the top level, the lifted variable pragmatic listener $L_{1}$ interprets an utterance $u$, inferring the state $s$ and resolving the variable $V$. $L_{1}$ now reasons about the speaker, who presumably has an interpretation (i.e., a value for $V$) in mind.

\ex. \emph{The lifted variable pragmatic listener}:\\
$P_{L_{1}}(s,V|u) \propto P_{S_{1}}(u|s,V) \cdot P(s) \cdot P(V)$

To capture the speaker's epistemic state, our model needs one last element. Following \cite{goodmanstuhlmuller2013}, we include a parameter $a$ determining the speaker's possibly incomplete access to the world state $s$. Now, the speaker makes an observation $o$ about the state $s$, and, depending on the speaker's perceptual access $a$, $o$ might be identical to $s$ (i.e., the speaker has full access to information about the state) or a summary of $s$ (say, its sum, corresponding to the speaker's only having access to the total size or weight of the state). From the observation $o$ and his perceptual access $a$, the speaker generates an expectation about the states $s$ that $o$ might have been an observation of. For example, if the speaker only has perceptual access to the sum of some state (e.g., total weight), the speaker would infer a distribution over the possible individual properties that could have generated that observation (e.g., the weights of individual boxes). The speaker thus selects an utterance $u$ to convey information about the likely state $s$ that generated the observation $o$. The revised  pragmatic speaker model, \Next, takes into account perceptual access and potential uncertainty about the world state. Here, the pragmatic speaker calculates a belief distribution over what the actual state $s$ would be given the observation $o$ and perceptual access $a$: $P(s|o,a)$.

\ex. $P_{S_{1}} (u|o,a,V) \propto \textrm{exp}(\alpha \mathbb{E}_{P(s|o,a)}[U_{S_{1}} (u;s,V)])$

Where speaker's access to knowledge is shared between speakers and listeners (in our experimental setting, participants knew whether Cubert moved the boxes together or inspected each individually), $a$ is shared between $S_{1}$ and $L_{1}$. The full lifted variable RSA model of plural predication appears in Fig.~\ref{pluralRSA}.

\end{figure}

 To summarize: the pragmatic listener resolves ambiguity while interpreting an utterance by reasoning about the pragmatic speaker, who chooses utterances most likely to communicate some state via a specific interpretation to a naive, literal listener. The speaker and pragmatic listener track the speaker's access to knowledge, which determines whether the speaker has limited access to the state about which he communicates. In other words, listeners reason about likely interpretations of ambiguous plural predications given their intuitive understanding of speakers and their prior knowledge of the world (i.e., which states and interpretations are \emph{a priori} likely).

To generate qualitative and quantitative predictions that we may compare with our experimental results, we need to fix various parameter settings within the model. Here we fill in more details of these settings, with the caveat that the qualitative model results presented below are robust to a broad range of parameter settings; the specific values we give here are used merely to demonstrate the general behavior and success of the model.\footnote{XXX specifics about the range of parameter settings that are possible, and the settings that are not.\label{parameter}}

 States $s$ correspond to ordered sets of four objects, which hold scalar properties. More specifically, states are sets of positive integers, for example $\{3, 3, 4, 4\}$ or $\{3, 4, 4, 4\}$. Taking these objects as stand-ins for boxes and their properties as stand-ins for individual box sizes, the state $\{3, 3, 4, 4\}$ corresponds to a plurality of four boxes, two of size 3 and two of size 4. States are formed by drawing four times from a uniform prior distribution over boxes (i.e., objects); boxes come in two sizes: 3 or 4.
 
 Next, the utterances. Speakers have the choice between three utterances: one {unambiguously distributive} (e.g., \emph{the boxes each are big}), one {unambiguously collective} (e.g., \emph{the boxes together are big}), and the last {ambiguous} between a distributive and collective interpretation (e.g., \emph{the boxes are big}). The ambiguous utterance is always at least as cheap (in terms of the cost to the speaker) as the unambiguous utterances. In \Next, we give the semantics for these utterances, to be used in our model by the literal listener $L_{0}$.
 
 \ex. \emph{Utterance semantics}:
 \a. \sem{\texttt{distributive}} = \lam $s$. \texttt{distributive-interpretation}($s$)
 \b. \sem{\texttt{collective}} = \lam $s$. \texttt{collective-interpretation}($s$)
 \b. \sem{\texttt{ambiguous}} = \lam $V$\lam $s$. \texttt{if} $V$ = \textsc{collective}, \texttt{then}\\  \textcolor{white}{\sem{\texttt{ambiguous}} = \lam $V$\lam $s$. }\texttt{collective-interpretation}($s$)\\
 \textcolor{white}{\sem{\texttt{ambiguous}} = \lam $V$\lam $s$. }\texttt{else}, \\
 \textcolor{white}{\sem{\texttt{ambiguous}} = \lam $V$\lam $s$. }\texttt{distributive-interpretation}($s$)
 
 The \texttt{distributive} utterance receives a distributive interpretation. The \texttt{collective} utterance receives a collective interpretation. The interpretation of the \texttt{ambiguous} utterance depends on the value of the interpretation-resolving variable $V$, which the pragmatic listener infers. When $V$ is \textsc{collective}, the utterance receives a collective interpretation; otherwise, the utterance receives a distributive interpretation. These interpretations carry the semantics in \Next.
 
 \ex. \emph{Interpretation semantics}:
 \a. \sem{\texttt{distributive-interpretation}} =
\begin{flushright}\lam $s$. $\forall$x$\in$$s$[x $>$ \texttt{distributive-threshold}]\end{flushright}
\b. \sem{\texttt{collective-interpretation}} = 
\begin{flushright}\lam $s$. (\texttt{sum}($s$) $\times$ \textcolor{red}{\texttt{noise}}) $>$ \texttt{collective-threshold}\end{flushright}

The \texttt{distributive-interpretation} is true of a state $s$ just in case each of its members exceeds some distributive threshold.\footnote{Following \cite{lassitergoodman2013}, we treat the threshold parameters as lifted variables that get resolved by the pragmatic listener as he interprets the speaker's utterance. So, strictly speaking, $V$ in Fig.~\ref{pluralRSA} represents not just the interpretation-resolving variable, but also the threshold variables for the gradable predicates.} In our box setting, this semantics captures the fact that the distributive interpretation of a gradable predicate is true of a plurality when each of its members exceeds a contextually-determined cutoff \citep{kennedy1999,lassitergoodman2013}. The \texttt{collective-interpretation} is true of a state $s$ just in case the sum of that state---the state taken together---exceeds some collective threshold. Here we capture the sum-based aggregation inherent to collective interpretations of gradable predicates \citep{scha1984}. So far, no deviation from the formal semantics tradition.

What sets this semantics apart from the tradition that informs it is the \textcolor{red}{\texttt{noise}} parameter in the \texttt{collective-interpretation}, a scalar multiplier of the set aggregate estimate. This parameter explicitly represents possible noise in the determination of, say, collective size. In other words, this parameter models the contextual predictability of a collective property, or the possibility that speakers and listeners will arrive at different truth values for a collective interpretation. For our purposes, lower noise (i.e., values closer to 1) corresponds to increased contextual predictability of the collective property. To evaluate the qualitative predictions of our model, we begin with the possible values for \textcolor{red}{\texttt{noise}} shown in Fig.~\ref{noises}, where, for example, the value of \texttt{low} \textcolor{red}{\texttt{noise}} equals 1 (i.e., no change to the state estimate) 100\% of the time; the value of \texttt{high} \textcolor{red}{\texttt{noise}} equals 0.5, 1, or 1.5 with equal probability (i.e., the state estimate is accurate a third of the time, or off by half two-thirds of the time).

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/noise_plots.eps}
	\vspace{-20pt}
	\caption{\textcolor{red}{\texttt{noise}} priors used to evaluate the qualitative predictions of the plural predication model.} \label{noises}
\end{figure}

With \texttt{no} noise, our estimates are spot on and collective properties are maximally predictable from context. Increasing noise, contextual predictability decreases: our estimates of collective properties deviate from the true state. Noise is a property of the world context, and as such speakers and listeners both have access to its value. In other words, we assume that speakers and listeners are aware of the inherent contextual predictability of collective properties.

Lastly, to model speaker access to knowledge, the global parameter $a$ determines whether the speaker's state observation $o$ matches the state exactly (i.e., the speaker has full perceptual access to $s$), or whether it summarizes $s$ via summation (i.e., the speaker has limited perceptual access to $s$). Where $a$ is set to \texttt{full} knowledge, the speaker's belief distribution over possible states is exact, a delta distribution over \emph{the} state (Fig.~\ref{speakerbelief}, left). Having observed $\{3,3,4,4\}$, the speaker knows the state is $\{3,3,4,4\}$ (and not, say, $\{4,4,3,3\}$). Where $a$ is set to \texttt{partial} knowledge, the speaker's belief distribution is broader (Fig.~\ref{speakerbelief}, right). With \texttt{partial} knowledge, the speaker only observes the sum of the individual state values, say 14. But more than one state could generate this value, namely any combination of two size 3 boxes with two size 4 boxes.\footnote{In its simplest form, our model includes only objects of two different sizes (3 and 4), so that speaker uncertainty over states concerns the order of the state-internal objects. Including more possible objects (i.e., more possible object sizes) introduces additional uncertainty over the identity of state-internal objects. We present the simpler model here for illustrative purposes only. As mentioned in fn.~\ref{parameter} above, all of the model predictions we report are robust to a broad range of parameter settings, including a prior over individual objects that includes more than two possible values. In fact, including more possible objects serves merely to increase potential speaker uncertainty and thus enhance the effect of speaker knowledge.}

\end{figure}

Finally, we have the pieces needed to generate predictions from the plural predication model. Given our interest in the effects of noise and speaker knowledge on the interpretation of potentially ambiguous plural predications, of primary interest is the value of the interpretation-resolving variable $V$ for the \texttt{ambiguous} utterance. In Fig.~\ref{modelresults}, we plot the probability that $V$ is \texttt{collective} after hearing the \texttt{ambiguous} utterance; in other words, we plot the probability of a collective interpretation as a function of collective noise and speaker knowledge.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/model-results2.eps}
	\vspace{-20pt}
	\caption{Model predictions for the probability of the \texttt{ambiguous} utterance receiving a collective interpretation as a function of collective interpretation noise and speaker knowledge access.} \label{modelresults}
\end{figure}

The qualitative predictions of our plural predication model match the intuitions and experimental results that motivated the model in the first place. Perhaps most striking is the monotonic increase in probability of collective interpretations as collective noise decreases. That is to say, as noise decreases, collective properties become more predictable in context, and collective interpretations become more likely. We now have a formal understanding as to why this effect holds: the noisier the collective interpretation, the less likely the listener $L_{0}$ is to correctly resolve the question under discussion, namely the properties of the named boxes $s$. Given that the speaker $S_{1}$'s goal is to successfully communicate $s$ to $L_{0}$, the noisier an interpretation, the less useful it is at achieving this goal; the speaker is therefore less likely to intend this interpretation, and as a result the pragmatic listener $L_{1}$ is less likely to infer it.

Another outcome of our model's predictions is the increase in the probability of a collective interpretation as the speaker's knowledge access becomes limited. With only partial access to the actual state $s$---such that the speaker's observation $o$ of $s$ is its summation--- $S_{1}$ is less likely to have precise information concerning $s$ about which to communicate. $L_{1}$ tracks  $S_{1}$'s epistemic state, and therefore knows whether the speaker has full or partial knowledge. In the case of partial knowledge, a distributive interpretation lacks perceptual/epistemic support, and therefore becomes less likely; as a result, collective interpretations become more likely.

We have verified the qualitative predictions of our account of plural predication: increasing the contextual predictability of collective properties (by decreasing estimate noise) increases the probability of collective interpretations; and, regardless of the amount of collective noise, removing support for a distributive interpretation (by limiting the speaker's access to individual properties) decreases the probability of a distributive interpretation and thus increases the probability of a collective interpretation. Crucially, both of these qualitative predictions are borne out while making minimal assumptions concerning model parameters. Once we fit these parameters to the human data collected in Expt.~3, we may test both qualitative and quantitative predictions of the model.

Comparing the model predictions in Fig.~\ref{modelresults} to the rates of collective endorsement from Expt.~3 in Fig.~\ref{resultsexpt2}, the first thing to notice is the overall higher rates of collective endorsement in the human data. To capture this fact, we can change the prior probability of a collective interpretation, $p(V)$, in our model. In Fig.~\ref{modelresults}, that parameter is set to 0.5, or chance; to achieve a maximal fit between our model and the dependent measure from Expt.~3, we fit that parameter to 0.88 for each of the three predicates.

To evaluate the role of speaker knowledge, we look only at judgments for plural predications with \emph{heavy} (the knowledge manipulation had no measurable affect on \emph{tall} or \emph{big}). Here we fit only the specific values for noise in the model; all other parameters remain unchanged. With \emph{heavy}-specific values for ``random'' and ``regular'' noise, we generate the model predictions in Fig.~\ref{heavymodel}, plotted with average collective endorsement ratings for \emph{heavy} from Expt.~3. Perhaps surprisingly, by simply assuming that the collective interpretations of \emph{heavy} have \emph{heavy}-specific values for noise in context, we achieve a near exact fit between the model and the human data it predicts.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/heavymodel2.eps}
	\vspace{-20pt}
	\caption{Fitted model predictions and human data from Expt.~3 for collective interpretations of \emph{heavy}; variability of context (i.e., ``random'' vs.~``regular'') is modeled by noise in the collective interpretation, and the scenario manipulation (i.e., ``inspect'' vs.~``move'') is modeled by speaker's perceptual access to knowledge of the state (``full'' vs.~``partial'').} \label{heavymodel}
\end{figure}

Next, for \emph{big} and \emph{tall} we again have the model predict collective endorsement, this time collapsing over the scenario manipulation. As with \emph{heavy}, we fit predicate-specific values for collective interpretation noise. Also, we cheapen the cost of the ambiguous utterance relative to the unambiguous ones; in place of the flat prior distribution over possible utterances used above, here we set the utterance prior such that \texttt{ambiguous} is twice as cheap as \texttt{collective} or \texttt{distributive} (a reasonable assumption from the point of view of production, given that costlier, unambiguous utterances contain an extra word). With no other changes to model parameters, we generate the predictions plotted in Fig.~\ref{bigtallmodel}; once again, the fit is near perfect.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/bigtallmodel2.eps}

\end{figure}

In addition to the match between the qualitative predictions of our model and the human data from Expt.~3, we have shown that fitting predicate-specific parameters for noise and utterance cost yields near exact quantitative predictions of human behavior. Put simply, our model of plural predication, which explicates the ways that speakers and listeners reason about each other as they communicate, succeeds. %Collective interpretations become more likely as the properties they name become more predictable in context.


\section{General discussion}

We began with an age-old observation about collective interpretations for gradable predicates with plural subjects: some predicates admit collective interpretations, while others strongly (or totally) resist them. This phenomenon, dubbed ``stubborn distributivity'' after those predicates that ostensibly refuse collective interpretations, has been documented and described, even characterized in terms of semantic constraints. But an explanation of the phenomenon has proven elusive. Here, we offer an explanation: stubbornly distributive predicates are so because the collective properties they name are unpredictable, or unstable, in context; this unpredictability results in a noisy collective interpretation, something speakers and listeners recognize as ineffective for communicating efficiently about their world.

We found evidence for this information-theoretic explanation over the course of three experiments. First, in Expt.~1, we verified the phenomenon of stubborn distributivity, demonstrating that \emph{big} resists collective interpretations while \emph{heavy} admits them. The results of Expt.~1 also begin to demonstrate the role of speaker access to knowledge, something both speakers and listeners track as they communicate with each other. In a scenario where speakers plausibly lacked epistemic support for a distributive interpretation, collective interpretations became more likely.

In Expt.~2, we applied our paraphrase endorsement method to naturally-occurring examples in the absence of specific referents. Once again, we saw that interpretations are likely to the extent that a speaker plausibly holds the knowledge to verify them. We also began to find evidence of the role of contextual predictability in collective interpretations: for stubbornly distributive \emph{big} and \emph{small}, collective endorsement ratings increased for nominal subjects with a relatively predictable arrangement or evaluation strategy for collective size.

In Expt.~3, we further pursued the speaker knowledge effect while testing more directly the role of contextual predictability in collective predication. After manipulating the regularity of the predication context, we found that more regular contexts yielded greater rates of collective paraphrase endorsement. We thus confirmed our hypothesis: increasing contextual predictability of collective properties---by increasing the regularity of the contexts themselves---increases rates of collective interpretations. In other words, rates of collective interpretation were shown to be influenced by an interaction between the predictability of the property named and the context of predication. Also in Expt.~3, we indirectly manipulated speaker access to knowledge, again finding that without the evidence to verify it, an interpretation becomes less likely.

Having both demonstrated and quantified the role of contextual predictability and speaker knowledge in plural predication, we then formalized the role of each factor in a computational model of communication. Our model, conceived within the Rational Speech-Act framework, employed a standard semantics to achieve not only accurate qualitative, but accurate quantitative predictions of our human data. Speaker knowledge affected collective interpretations by removing epistemic support and thereby decreasing a speaker's utility for distributive interpretations. Contextual predictability had a similar effect: noisier collective interpretations are less effective at correctly communicating about the world; being less useful, they are less likely.

In what follows, we discuss in more detail the consequences of these findings for the theories they inform.

\subsection{Implications for semantic theories of plural predication}

Plural predication is heavily dependent on the context in which that predication occurs. Taking as our starting point the null hypothesis that all such predications are potentially ambiguous between collective and distributive interpretations, we saw that speakers and listeners track properties of the context (and of each other) as they endeavor to resolve this ambiguity. By considering plural predication within an articulated formal theory of communication (i.e., the Rational Speech-Act framework), we have identified and isolated two elements of this calculus: a) the speaker's access to knowledge; and b) noise in the estimation of properties, or contextual predictability. For present purposes, it is this latter element, contextual predictability, that features most prominently in our explanation of stubborn distributivity.

Recall that current theories of stubborn distributivity describe it as a constraint on the sort of subjects certain predicates may compose with. Specifically, stubbornly distributive predicates refuse pluralities from their basic denotations. 
Given the prohibition on plural subjects in their basic denotations, stubbornly distributive predicates simply cannot deliver collective interpretations. At the very least, the results of our experiments demonstrate that stubborn distributivity should not (indeed, cannot) manifest in terms of an all-out prohibition against collective interpretations. Even unabashedly stubbornly distributive predicates like \emph{big} yield greater rates of collective interpretations when context supports them. And it is the way that context supports collective interpretations that provides the key to understanding where stubborn distributivity comes from in the first place: contextual predictability.

Complaisantly collective predicates like \emph{heavy} or \emph{expensive} do not require support from context to ensure that their collective properties are predictable. The properties of collective weight and price are inherently stable in context; there exists but one way to evaluate these properties, and they persist despite changing physical arrangement. Not so for the collective properties named by stubbornly distributive predicates like \emph{big} or \emph{round}, which name properties of size or shape. Owing to uncertainty in evaluation strategy, compounded by definitional dependence on physical arrangement, these collective properties are relatively unpredictable, unstable, and as a result difficult for speakers and listeners to coordinate on in the absence of additional contextual or linguistic cues. Grammar might encode stubborn distributivity as a preference against plural arguments for certain predicates, but here we suggest a lower level explanation for this preference: stubbornly distributive predicates name collective properties that are difficult to accurately communicate. Increasing the contextual predictability of these properties as we did in Expt.~3 decreases this difficulty and thereby increases the utility and likelihood of collective interpretations.

Further evidence for the non-trivial role of contextual predictability in collective predication comes from data demonstrating that one and the same predicate receives varying rates of collective interpretations depending on the noun that serves as its subject. Looking at naturally-occurring examples of plural predication, we identified the most frequent subject nouns for the stubbornly distributive predicates \emph{big} and \emph{small} in a plural predication sentence frame. These predicates generally resisted collective interpretations, as we would expect if they were stubbornly distributive, but certain subject nouns yielded greater rates of collective interpretations. Crucially, these were the subject nouns that suggested relatively specific collective properties. 
The same mechanism we saw at play in the context manipulation of Expt.~3 rears its head here: contextual predictability of the collective property determines availability of collective interpretations.

Note that subject nouns already played a crucial role in the disambiguation of plural predications. \cite{schwarzschild2011} observed that physically aggregating a plurality using an atomizing noun like \emph{pile} or \emph{stack} greatly increases the availability of collective interpretations. He observed a similar, though opposite effect for mass nouns, which lack any information about physical arrangement. Again, semantics might attend to the atomic status of the resulting noun phrase in its evaluation of stubborn distributivity (e.g., \emph{the pile of boxes} names a single atom, while \emph{the boxes} most likely does not), but pragmatics provides us with an explanation for why these collectivizing nouns seem to unlock the collective interpretation. Just as our contextual manipulation in Expt.~3 increased contextual predictability of collective size or height by increasing the likelihood of encountering a plurality of boxes in a specific physical arrangement, so too do atomizing nouns. The arrangement of a \emph{stack} or \emph{pile} of boxes is much more regular across contexts than an abstract collection thereof. It is this regularity introduced by the atomizing noun that permits an otherwise elusive collective interpretation; the information-theoretic mechanism remains the same.

To understand this mechanism, namely how contextual predictability affects the calculus of interpretation choice, we modeled its contribution explicitly within a computational model of plural predication. The success of this model adds to the growing body of support for the central role of rational inference in communication; we turn next to its details.

\subsection{Implications for formal models of pragmatics}

Our explanation for stubborn distributivity relies on a sophisticated process of recursive reasoning involving listeners and speakers. Speakers choose utterances to efficiently and accurately resolve some question under discussion, reasoning about how a naive listener would interpret their utterance and weighing its relative cost. Listeners know this, and interpret the utterance they receive with this intuitive theory of speakers in mind. That is, listeners reason about speakers reasoning about listeners. By considering utterance semantics within this articulated model of pragmatics, what began as a description of the phenomenon---certain predicates resist collective interpretations---now has an explanation: speakers avoid interpretations that are unlikely to correctly resolve the question under discussion (i.e., collective interpretations of stubbornly distributive predicates), and listeners know this about speakers, so they avoid inferring interpretations that speakers avoid using.

Thanks to recent advances in computational cognitive science (in our case, simulation-based probabilistic programs), we are able to move beyond simply describing this reasoning process by implementing a formal pragmatic model to derive not just qualitative, but quantitative predictions. Formulated within the Rational Speech-Act framework, our model leveraged Bayesian inference, together with minimal assumptions about utterance semantics and cost, to match near-perfectly participants' behavior in our experimental paradigm. The model's success and structure serve to support the intuitions that motivated it: increasing the contextual predictability of collective properties increases the probability of an ambiguous plural predication receiving a collective interpretation. Given its discrete, isolable components, we can identify the contribution of this effect at each level of inference. 

Recall the general structure of the plural predication model from Fig.~\ref{pluralRSA}: the pragmatic listener $L_{1}$ reasons about the speaker $S_{1}$ reasoning about a naive listener $L_{0}$. At the lowest level of inference, $L_{0}$ interprets an utterance $u$ according to some interpretation $V$ to determine the state of affairs $s$. We model contextual predictability as the inverse of noise in the collective interpretation, which manifests as a scalar multiplier of the estimated collective property. In other words, as collective noise increases, contextual predictability of the collective property decreases. At the level of $L_{0}$, noise serves to decrease the probability of correctly resolving the state. Descriptively, the distribution over states $L_{0}$ infers is flatter as a function of noise. Simply put, noisier interpretations are less informative.

At the second level of inference, $S_{1}$ is aware of this effect of noise on $L_{0}$, and takes it into account as he estimates the utility of his utterance. Noisier, less informative interpretations are less useful for $S_{1}$ to achieve the goal of correctly resolving $s$, and as a result $S_{1}$ is less likely to use them. At the highest level of inference, $L_{1}$ is the aware of the effect of noise on the choice of $S_{1}$'s utterance interpretations. Given this effect, $L_{1}$ is less likely to resolve the interpretation as collective (and thus is more likely to resolve it as distributive) as noise increases. As a result, the probability of a collective interpretation for an ambiguous utterance (e.g., \emph{The boxes are big}) decreases as noise increases. To correctly predict the human data concerning collective interpretations from Expt.~3, all we needed was to assign different values for collective noise to the different predicates in our model. Again, the success of this manipulation confirms our original hypothesis: different predicates carry different amounts of noise with their collective properties, which determines their relative rates of collective interpretations.

Further supporting the general framework of rational inference in communication, our model also captured (both qualitatively and quantitatively) the affect of speaker knowledge on interpretation choice. We observed that in scenarios where speakers likely lacked information about individual properties, collective interpretations were more prevalent. We hypothesized a source for this effect: without epistemic support for distributive interpretations, collective interpretations are more useful to speakers, and thus more probable for listeners. The success of the speaker access to knowledge parameter, $a$, in our model lends credence to this hypothesis. As in the case of modeling contextual predictability, we may trace the source of this effect to its start.

Speakers and listeners are aware of speakers' perceptual access to knowledge, $a$. When $a$ is partial, distributive interpretations are less informative because the speaker's epistemic support for the interpretation is incomplete. Concretely, $S_{1}$'s goal is to align the naive listener $L_{0}$'s beliefs about the state $s$ with his own. $L_{0}$ forms those beliefs on the basis of $S_{1}$'s utterance (and prior knowledge), and in the case of partial knowledge a distributive interpretation gives $L_{0}$ more information than $S_{1}$ had in the first place. In such a case, this process of alignment is relatively unsuccessful; $S_{1}$ could have done better by intending a collective interpretation, which would have given $L_{0}$ a belief about $s$ much closer to $S_{1}$'s own belief. The pragmatic listener $L_{1}$ models this reasoning, and updates the inference over intended interpretations accordingly. Being less informative under partial access to knowledge, distributive interpretations are less useful and thus less likely. By decreasing the probability of distributive interpretations, limiting access to knowledge results in an increase in the probability of the collective interpretation.

With both contextual predictability and speaker knowledge, our modeling approach has allowed for the specification and testing of hypotheses situated at the interface between semantics and pragmatics: how utterance semantics interacts with properties of context---both linguistic and more broadly construed---to resolve the intended interpretation of potentially ambiguous utterances. Beyond the domain of plural predication, the lessons learned have far reach: speakers and listeners prefer more stable, more potentially informative utterances/interpretations; they also reason rationally about the evidence available as messages are selected. Ambiguity is endemic to natural language (for a recent discussion, see \citealp{piantadosietal2012}); taken out of context, nearly everything we say lacks its intended meaning. Both in our theories and in our daily lives, we therefore rely on context to specify the underspecified. Here we have demonstrated two ways context, together with the reasoning we bring to bear on it, achieves that goal.


\section{Conclusion}

We have seen that the phenomenon of stubborn distributivity, whereby certain gradable predicates resist collective interpretations, arises from an interaction between the rational reasoning processes of language users and qualities of the collective properties they name. Speakers and listeners require more coordination to align their beliefs about properties that are less predictable across contexts (e.g., collective size or shape, which might change as arrangements change). As a result, they require more support from context to accurately discuss these potentially variable, uncertain properties. This support might come in the form of words that increase contextual predictability (e.g., \emph{pile}, which regularizes otherwise variable physical arrangements) or from increasing the regularity of the context itself (e.g., by ensuring that sets realize a common physical arrangement). As collective properties become more predictable, collective interpretations become more informative, more useful, and therefore more likely.

\citeauthor{link1983} bases many of his claims on observations concerning the behavior of nominal conjunctions in English---these, he assumes, name pluralities; the sentences in \Next[a] together entail the sentence in \Next[b]. If each individual is a man, then taken together they are men.

\ex. \label{cumulative}\a. Alan is a man. Bill is a man. Charlie is a man.
\b. Alan, Bill, and Charlie are men.

To understand the \textsc{cumulative} inference in \Last, \citeauthor{link1983} makes some assumptions concerning the domain of individuals, together with the formal mechanism of predication (i.e., ascribing properties to individuals): set inclusion \citep[cf.][]{montague1973}.

First, the domain of individuals, D$_{e}$, consists of atomic individuals---objects in the domain without other objects as (proper) individual parts. This set includes individuals like Alan, Bill, Charlie, the book on your shelf, an apple, and so on. Predicates are modeled as sets of individuals---those individuals that hold the property named by the predicate. The denotation of a singular nominal predicate like (\emph{is a}) \emph{man} is a subset of this atomic domain.

\ex. \label{theboys} Let \sem{Alan} = \texttt{a}, \sem{Bill} = \texttt{b}, and \sem{Charlie} = \texttt{c}; assume no other men. Then,\\
 \sem{(is a) man} = \{\texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c}\}

Singular \emph{man} contains all and only those members of the atomic domain that hold the property of being a man---it contains the men in the domain. In \Last, where we assume three men, the set denoted by singular \emph{man} contains just Alan, Bill, and Charlie, or the individuals \tt{a}, \tt{b}, and \tt{c}.

Given the model sketched in \Last, and assuming predication gets modeled as set inclusion, the derivation in \Next results as we say of the sentence \emph{Alan is a man} that it is true: Alan is a man just in case he is a member of the set of singular men; Alan is in fact a member of the set of singular men, so he is a man.

\ex. \sem{Alan is a man} = 1 iff\\
\sem{man}(\sem{Alan}) = 1, i.e., iff\\
\texttt{a} $\in$ \{\texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c}\}

To achieve a general theory of predication, \citeauthor{link1983} must say how set inclusion transpires with plural predicates like \emph{men}; but first, \citeauthor{link1983} must take a stance on plural reference more broadly: (plural) individuals are modeled as mereological sums, points on mereological lattices that track part-whole relations. Simply put, a plurality is a sum of its parts: the plural individual named by \emph{Alan, Bill, and Charlie} is the summation of the singular individuals \tt{a}, \tt{b}, and \tt{c}. 

For \citeauthor{link1983}, pluralities are formed via the \textsc{individual sum} operator $\oplus$, which spells out in English as (some variants of) the conjunction \emph{and}.

\ex. For any two individuals \texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, their sum (i.e., the individual named by \emph{x and y}) is the smallest plural individual that has \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} as parts: \texttt{x}$\oplus$\texttt{y}

If there are three boys, as in \ref{theboys}, then \emph{the boys} names the same plural individual as \emph{Alan and Bill and Charlie}, namely \texttt{a}$\oplus$\texttt{b}$\oplus$\texttt{c}. The spatial, structural, and functional arrangement of this sum is left unspecified. It merely represents the collection, however arranged, of the three individuals.

Now, (semantically) plural nominal predicates (e.g., \emph{men}) contain pluralities in their extensions; to build a plural predicate from singular ones, \citeauthor{link1983} introduces the ``star''-operator, *, which takes a predicate \texttt{P} and generates all of the individual sums of members of the extension of the basic, ``un-starred'' predicate. Roughly speaking, a plural predicate, *\texttt{P}, is a collection of all of the possible subsets of the singular predicate \texttt{P} (less the empty set \O).

\ex. \sem{*\texttt{P}} \defeq \{\texttt{x} $\in$ D$_{e}$: $\exists$\texttt{X} $\subseteq$ \sem{\texttt{P}}[\texttt{X} $\neq$ \O\ \and \texttt{x} = \texttt{S}(\texttt{X})]\}\\
where \texttt{S}(\texttt{X}) is the supremum, or maximal element of \texttt{X}

We can now model the denotation of English \emph{man} and \emph{men} using the sets in \Next; \emph{man} corresponds to the singular property of being a man, while \emph{men} corresponds to the closure of that property under sum-formation via the *-operator.\footnote{The present discussion collapses over the distinction between semantic and morphological plurality. See \cite{scontras2013salt,scontras2013sub,scontras2014diss} for fuller discussion of this distinction.} \emph{Men} thus denotes the set of all men and their possible combinations.

\ex. \texttt{P} = \texttt{man}\\
\sem{\texttt{P}} = \{\texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c}\}\\
\sem{*\texttt{P}} = \{\texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c}, \texttt{a}$\oplus$\texttt{b}, \texttt{a}$\oplus$\texttt{c}, \texttt{b}$\oplus$\texttt{c}, \texttt{a}$\oplus$\texttt{b}$\oplus$\texttt{c}\}

The semilattice in Fig.\ \ref{semilattice} conveys similar information, while explicitly tracking the part-whole relations among the individuals.
Each node $\bullet$ in Fig.\ \ref{semilattice} represents an individual in the domain, and the lines connecting the nodes track part-hood. For example, Alan and Bill are each individual parts of the plural individual named by \emph{Alan and Bill}, which itself is a part of the plural individual named by \emph{Alan, Bill, and Charlie}. Together, they are men, which means that each is a man.

The mereological representation of individuals in terms of individual part-hood introduces a natural ``part-of'' ordering on the domain,  which \citeauthor{link1983} represents in the object language using the predicate $\Pi$ ``individual part of''; the bidirectional in \Next holds: if \tt{a} is an individual part of the individual \tt{b}, then the plural individual \tt{a}\op\tt{b} is identical to \tt{b}.

\ex. \tt{a}$\Pi$\tt{b}\ \ $\leftrightarrow$\ \ \tt{a}\op\tt{b} = \tt{b}

In Fig.\ \ref{semilattice}, the individual part relation $\Pi$ gets represented by the line segments connecting nodes. Pluralities, or ``sums,'' are those individuals which have other individuals in the domain as proper parts; atoms have no proper parts.

\subsection{Varieties of plural predication}

Given that plural predicates are constructed from singular ones via sum-formation, we may model the cumulative inference in \ref{cumulative} (repeated in \Next): if each of Alan, Bill, and Charlie are in the extension of the predicate \emph{man}, then their sum is necessarily in the extension of the semantically plural predicate \emph{men}; \emph{men} is the closure of \emph{man} under sum-formation, so if \tt{a}, \tt{b}, and \tt{c} are in the extension of \emph{man}, their sum \tt{a}\op\tt{b}\op\tt{c} must be in the extension of \emph{men}.

The distributive reading of \Next[b] follows from this semantics of plurality and predication, not any implicit quantification over the members of the subject. In other words, we need no  distributive operator (e.g., a silent \emph{each}) in the logical form of \Next[b] to derive \Next[a] as an entailment.

\ex. \a. Alan is a man. Bill is a man. Charlie is a man.
\b. Alan, Bill, and Charlie are men.

To repeat: for Alan, Bill, and Charlie to be men, then \tt{a}\op\tt{b}\op\tt{c}---the sum named by \emph{Alan, Bill, and Charlie}---must be in the extension of the predicate named by \emph{men}. By assuming that \emph{men} corresponds to the closure of the singular predicate \emph{man}, it follows that each of Alan, Bill, and Charlie is a man whenever we say of Alan, Bill, and Charlie that they are men.

Here is where terminology begins to get confusing:
